            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And on the other ſide, it is left as a ſtaine vnto the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of others, that they did not take away occaſions of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and remoue ſuch ſtumbling blockes out of mens wayes. If then we could in ſuch a godly conſent, as the Prophet <hi>Sophonie</hi> ſaith, ſerue the Lord <hi>with one ſhoulder,</hi> the ciuil magiſtrates,<note place="margin"> Zophon. 3.9.</note> by the ſword, we by the word: they by correction (if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) we by exhortations: they by puniſhments, we by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, remembring that both the one and the other must one day make an account of our ſtewardſhip, and anſwere for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults: then I doubt not but God would bleſſe our godly labors, with great increaſe of knowlege and godlines. But, as in the end of this treatiſe, I haue made ſome exhortation vnto magiſtrates, to conſider of their dutie in this point, ſo haue I alſo thought it my part to maintaine to my power, Truth againſt Falſhood euen Gods word againſt mens inuentions. And for this cauſe haue I taken this trauell, to ſet downe the ſumme of that that we teach, eſpecially in ſuch matters as are principally in queſtion amongſt vs: and on the contrary, what our aduerſaries teach concerning the ſame. Which I thought to be neceſſary, becauſe our doctrine is many times by the aduerſaries ſlandered, eſpecially before ſuch as are ignorant, as though it were far otherwiſe than in truth it is. And that the truth more eaſly may appeare, what is taught by them and vs, he that liſteth may ſee with little labor, euen as it were at one view both our opinions. Neither do I vndertake to ſet downe all that we teach concerning thoſe articles, but onely the points that doe eſpecially belong to the controuerſies that are betweene vs. Then alſo haue I ſet downe the principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby they confirme their doctrines, and indeuour to confute them. Wherein eſpecially I alleadge M. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſons (though not alwayes) becauſe he is accounted learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs, and alſo commeth after others, ſo that he hath ſeene
<pb facs="tcp:13152:4"/> what others haue, and hath taken out of them what he liketh. And as in all this treatiſe, my endeuour is to proue (I truſt with ſome good effect) that the doctrine of the church of Rome is not catholike, ſo that it may the better appeare, I haue towards the end ſet downe an abridgement of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> whereby I truſt the meaneſt that ſeeth it ſhalbe able to iudge, how they make an vniuſt claime to the catholike religion. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know my own wants, and could rather ſubmit my ſelfe to be a ſcholer vnto many, than a teacher almoſt of any: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (I know not how) my minde giueth me, that this manner of writing may do ſome good, eſpecially among the vnlearned that are deſirous to be taught, I thought my duetie forced me to take this in hand, though I want many helpes and meanes that other haue. And, to whom ſhould this my labour (ſuch as it is) be due rather than vnto you, next after that place where I did ſucke as it were my firſt milke of learning, and laid almoſt the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that knowledge (ſuch as it is) that God hath indued mee withall? By your good liberalitie, I confeſſe my ſelfe to be the better inabled to do any good (be it neuer ſo little that I can do) in the church of God. To your Worſhips therefore I confeſſe this my trauell to be due, as a ſimple token of my ſincere heart, which would haue yeelded a better remembrance, if my abilitie could haue affoorded it. And the rather do I dedicate this Booke vnto your W.

                        </label> Firſt, this ground doeth not vpholde that which is in controuerſie among vs. For they ſhoulde prooue traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to bee a part of Gods worde, ſo that without them Gods word could not bee counted perfect. And to proue that, they tel vs, that it was more than two thouſand yeeres before the woord was written. Which maketh nothing for them, vnleſſe they can ſhew vs, that this word which is now written, is not that ſame that before was deliuered by tradition vnto the fathers of that old world. For the queſtion betweene vs and the Papiſts, is not of the maner of deliuering Gods word, whether it were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by word or by writing: but of the matter, namely, whether Gods word be any thing elſe, than that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the old and new teſtament, which we deny, but they affirme it, becauſe the word was ſo long time vnwritten, &amp; yet the church was not then without the word. So that becauſe the word was reuealed after an other manner, the Papiſts wil haue it another word. Whereas in trueth that ſame word that was <hi>from the beginning,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 
                           <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1 what word that is that is written.</note> is that verie word of God, that was ſo long after the beginning written for the Iewes, and is now deliuered vnto vs. Wee muſt therefore take heede that they deceiue vs not by the double ſignification of the word <hi>Scripture,</hi> which ſometime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the manner of deliuering the word, namely, by writing, and ſo we confeſſe, the ſcripture was not ſo anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as the church by mo than two thouſand yeares, but ſometime the word <hi>Scripture</hi> ſignifieth the word it ſelfe which is deliuered vnto vs, as it is commonly now taken, and in this place muſt ſo be vnderſtoode. And ſo hath the
<pb facs="tcp:13152:7"/> word written beene from the beginning. That is to ſay, that the ſelfe ſame word, which God, by word of mouth (as we ſay) and by tradition did teach the patriarkes, hee afterwards did cauſe to be written, which word wee call the holy ſcriptures. And further alſo we muſt remember, that one manner of deliuering the word of God,<note place="margin"> Diuerſe maners of deliuering the word at diuerſe times.</note> is fit for one time, and an other manner of deliuering it for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. As may appeare by that which hath beene ſaid, how that God hath in his infinite wiſedome ſeene it neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to deliuer it one way afore the Lawe, in an other ſort vnder the Lawe, and the Goſpell, although not in like meaſure in both theſe latter times. So that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot ſtand good: The ſcriptures haue not beene written in the firſt age amongſt the patriarkes, therefore they are not neceſſary now amongſt vs in theſe dayes, to whom God hath by them reuealed his word.

<pb facs="tcp:13152:13"/> may of the ſcriptures gather much fruit, if they will dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and with calling vpon God for help reade the ſame. So that in briefe this is all that theſe fathers haue ſaid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that many things are hard, which no body denieth, or elſe, that none can ſo ſound the depth of them, but that ſomething may alwayes be added thereto: and therefore that with diligence the ſcriptures muſt be ſearched, and without loathſomnes, yea with reuerence receiued. But that wee may, the more eaſily and euidently ſee how little theſe fathers do make for them: it is neceſſary to ſee with what purpoſe, and to what end theſe ſay, that they do write of the hardneſſe of the ſcriptures. Namely, not to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men from reading of them, but to ſtirre them vp to more diligence and carefulneſſe in reading them. As may appeare by the earneſt and vehement exhortations, which the ancient fathers doe make, not onely to all men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin"> Hom. 9. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ.</note> but euen to lay men in particular and eſpecially. <hi>Heare</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome) all yee lay men that are preſent, and that haue wiues and children, howe the Apoſtle commandeth euen (you eſpecially) to reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not to reade them only as it were by chance, but with great diligence:</hi> with many other ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations in that place, as alſo in many other of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in ſundry of his epiſtles vnto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly women exhorteth them to diligent reading of the ſame, he alſo, to intice them to be conuerſant therein, dedicateth vnto ſome women ſom of his treatiſes vpon the ſcriptures.

Yea, I haue knowen bachellors of diuinity admitted to reade ſome booke of the maſter of ſentences, as the vſe then was when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, ſo that this was their concluſion: They are hard, therefore you ſhall not reade them.

                        </label> That the weakeneſſe and wickedneſſe of this argument may appeare, let vs firſt conſider who is the Author of the holy ſcriptures, which the Apoſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as plainly as can be when he ſaith,<note place="margin"> 2. Tim. 3.16.</note> 
                        <hi>The whole ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is giuen by inſpiration from God.</hi> Therefore the ſcripture is the word, not of man, but of God. Secondly, let vs ſee how this word came to vs, whether by tradition of the church or by ſpecial reuelation. Which alſo is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered by ſaint <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin"> 2. Pet. 1.21</note> that <hi>prophecie came not in olde time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were mooued by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> What will we then ſay? ſhall we imagin that God would direct by his holy Spirite the mouthes of his ſeruants to ſpeake, but not their pennes to write? God forbid. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the men whome it pleaſed God to vſe as his meanes in ſetting downe this word, were knowen vnto the church of that time wherein they flouriſhed, and their calling ſo confirmed vnto the godly, that without all doubt or waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they receiued thoſe writings as Gods word, becauſe they knew the authors thereof to be directed by Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                     <p>And this is the difference that the ancient fathers doe make, betweene thoſe Bookes of ſcripture, whoſe authors were knowen, and their bookes alwayes receiued, and</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13152:18"/>
                     <p>therefore called Canonicall, that is, ſuch as deliuer rules for life and doctrine that are infallible: and thoſe other that are called Apocrypha, <hi>becauſe either it was not knowen who wrote them, or elſe it was not knowen that they were indued with ſuch a ſpirite, as they could not erre in any thing.</hi> And therefore their Bookes were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the church then. Is it not then intollerable pride in the church of Rome, to commaund ſilence vnto God himſelfe, and not to ſuffer him to ſpeake, but when they giue him leaue, and to proclame it vnto the world, that euen his word is not of credite, vnleſſe it be by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and allowance of the ſame. And yet thus doe they ſay when they affirme, that <hi>the Scriptures are not Canonicall, but by the approbation of the Church.</hi> Yea, ſome make them no better <hi>than Eſopes Fables, if the Church allowe not of them.</hi> O blaſphemie intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable! if this their argument might bee allowed, then the church of Rome, which falſely challengeth to bee the church,<note place="margin"> Cauſ. 15.

But to be ſhort, I will againſt their argument
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13152:18"/> oppoſe this. Whatſoeuer ſcriptures are not giuen by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God ſpirit, and by the godly receiued into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the ſcripturs, thoſe are not the word of God, though they haue the approbation of the latter churches: but ſuch are the Bookes which wee call Apocrypha, which the councell of Trent would make of like authoritie with the canonicall Scriptures, therefore thoſe Bookes are not the vndoubted word of God. And howe can any body i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that that which once hath beene not canonicall, can by continuaunce of time, and confirmation of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come canonicall, or that which God hath not vouched woorthy to bee his word in times paſt, that nowe at the laſt he ſhould acknowledge the ſame, as though hee were nowe chaunged or had repented him of his former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>Admit once this doctrine of theirs, and farewell all certaintie in religion. For men will wander from one thing to an other, as wee ſee in the kingdome of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Poperie where there is no ende of deuotions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, and inuentions of men. So that that which was good chriſtianitie in the dayes of Chriſt and of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is nowe holden to be farre from the perfection of a godly life, vnleſſe wee doe helpe it with our will-worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, and by the obeying the preceptes of the church. Nay, graunt them this, and then that worde written that wee haue, it ſhall ſpeake nothing but Romiſh, ſo that whatſoeuer is the meaning and true ſenſe of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet God muſt be taught to ſpeake as the church of Rome will haue him.<note place="margin"> De verbo dei lib. 4. cap. 11.</note> To this ende tendeth that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon axiome receiued of them all, and vſed by <hi>Bellarmine.

And for proofe hereof they alledge this article, <hi>I beleeue the Catholike church,</hi> yet when they ſhould tell vs what this Catholike church is, wherevnto we muſt ſo neceſſarily be ſubiect, they onely paint vnto vs I know not what Romiſh Church,<note place="margin"> The catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Creed, and the Romiſh contrary.</note> which is no more like the true Catholike church, than that church of Iſrael, when it was ſtarted aſide from the true worſhip of God, was like to the true church of God that remained amongeſt the people of the Iewes, as by theſe few rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may appeare. The catholike church is <hi>One,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> One</note> that is to ſay, one companie, and vnited and knit togither by one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and the ſelfe ſame graces, but the reprobate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly (who fill vp a place in the Romiſh catholike church) neither are one company with the Saints, nor vnited to them by the ſame ſpirit and graces, to be partakers of the communion of Saints: Therefore that catholike and the Romiſh catholike Church are not all one.

And although a man haue not one good thing in him, not one crum of honeſtie, hee is good enough to make vp a number in the Church of Rome, but ſuch a church is not holy, and therefore not that that is mentioned in the Creede.

But the Romiſh catholike church receiueth only them that acknowledge the biſhop of Rome to be their head. If then they dare not affirme the pope to be the head of them that are in heauen, I truſt they will not from henceforth charge vs to be iniurious to the church of Rome, if we affirme it not to bee the true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church. If they reply, that the church may bee called catholike in other reſpects than in that only which I haue mentioned. I graunt it. But the queſtion amongſt vs in deed is, whether the church of Rome be the true catholik church, which euen by our creed we are bound to beleeue. Which the papiſts affirm, &amp; therfore would haue the world to imagine that we deſpiſe the catholike church which is mentioned in the creede, when we vpon iuſt cauſes depart from that Romiſh church, which hath ſet it ſelfe, theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares againſt Gods church. As for the principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherby they would proue that they ſay, do nothing touch the catholike church, which is the thing in queſtion, but only the ſtate of the church in this life, and therefore are not worthie the repeating. But among other abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they are forced to grant, for to defend this their vntrue aſſertion, this is blaſphemous, although they all defend it, <hi>That ſome of the members of Chriſtes bodie ſhal not be ſaued.</hi> As though there were not vertue inough in Chriſt, to quicken all them that are grafted into him, whereas in truth, <hi>He that hath the ſonne hath life.</hi> That is alſo abſurd, that if the wicked and reprobate bee of the church of Chriſt, as they ſay, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are members of two

                        <hi>Theophilact</hi> in my iudgement moſt notablie ſheweth, that when Chriſt had promiſed to ſend the holy Ghoſt which ſhould lead into al truth, leaſt any body ſhould thereby imagin that the holy Ghoſt is greater than Chriſt, if it can make vs partakers of greater and mo things than Chriſt can, he addeth, <hi>Hee ſhall not ſpeake of himſelfe, that is, he ſhall ſpeake nothing of his owne, but that is mine.</hi> For he that ſayth <hi>(he ſhall ſpeake) whatſoeuer he hath hard,</hi> doth ſignifie, that he ſhal teach nothing but that which Chriſt hath taught. And theſe are the verie wordes of <hi>Theophilact,</hi> whereby he doth not onely ſay, that the
<pb facs="tcp:13152:25"/> holy Ghoſt can adde nothing of his owne to that which Chriſt hath taught, and ſo may not bring into the church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new doctrines, as the church of Rome doth vnder this colour, but alſo, that it is a diminiſhing of Chriſts glorie, and a preferring of the holy Ghoſt before Chriſt, to ſuppoſe that the holy Ghoſt can or may teach any thing in Gods church that hath not bin taught by Chriſt himſelfe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he mightily beateth downe that proude bragge of the church of Rome, wherby they ſeeke to exempt themſelues from all errour, becauſe they falſely chalenge vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that their doctrines and traditions are vnwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and to be beleeued as well as Gods worde, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from this ſpirit, whereas they are nothing conſonant to that which Chriſt taught, and therefore the ſpirite had no commiſſion to teach the ſame. Yea in vaine they ſay they are directed by Gods ſpirite, when as they teach that that Gods ſpirit neither can nor will teach, becauſe Chriſt hath not taught it before. Neither doe we derogate anie thing herein from the power of the ſpirit, whoſe direction if we could follow, we ſhould neuer do amiſſe: but impute it to our owne weaknes, &amp; ignorance, &amp; corruption, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that euen the godly many times grieue Gods ſpirit, and ſuffer him not to haue his perfect worke. Other arguments alſo they haue, but they haue ſcarce any ſhew of truth, and therefore I thinke them not worthie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering: for their places out of the fathers doe commend the faith of Rome that then was, and their conſtancie in the ſame, but what is that to this degenerate church of Rome that now is: of the church whereof we may ſay as one ſaith of their citie, that a man will ſeeke Rome in the midſt of Rome: So a man will ſeeke the church euen in the midſt of their moſt ſhewe of religion, and yet not finde it.</p>

But if otherwiſe any man, woman, or childe, being deſirous to enter into the felowſhip of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couenant, and to be incorporated by that Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence of Chriſt, ſhall die or depart out of this life, before they can attaine thereto: God forbid that we ſhould thinke either ſo vncharitably of them, as to iudge them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Gods mercy: or ſo hardly of God, as that hee would alter his eternall councell, for want of this external ſacrament: or ſo ſlenderly of the vertue of Chriſt his blood, as that without this water it can not waſh vs from ſinne. No doubt many died in the wilderneſſe, before the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites came to the land of promiſe, that had not the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of circumciſion, and alſo afterwards, by all likelihoode, in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13152:30"/> Babylon. The thiefe vpon the croſſe, of whoſe ſaluation we make no doubt, was not baptiſed. Yea, the order that God vſeth in ſauing vs, doeth teach vs, that without the Sacraments we may be ſaued,<note place="margin"> Rom. 8.30 Epheſ. 1.4</note> becauſe that election or predeſtination goeth before calling, whether it be internall by the ſpirit, or externall by the word and Sacraments. Therefore wee muſt either imagine Gods election not to be certaine, which is blaſphemous, or elſe, that all that are elect are ſaued, although they haue not oportunity to receiue that externall ſeale of Gods couenant. Therefore I ſay, that Baptiſme is very neceſſary, and in any wiſe to be vſed and receiued of them, that may according to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes inſtitution haue the ſame. But we deteſt that doctrine of the Papiſts, that teacheth it to be ſo neceſſary, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not baptized, can not be ſaued: whereupon they permit lay men, yea women to baptiſe, whereas the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> might not baptize, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> noteth, <hi>haereſ. <hi>97.</hi>

If then wee graunt that that place ſpeaketh of Baptiſme, as many of the Fathers haue thought, yet that which the Papiſtes inferre thereupon followeth not, for wee ſee, the working of grace is onely attributed to the ſpirite of God, contrary to that they doe teach.<note place="margin"> Bellarm de Sacrament. lib. 2. cap. 3</note> For they will needes haue vs to beleeue, that the Sacrament it ſelfe by receiuing of it, giueth grace. But good reaſons may be yeelded, why by water in that place, the water of Baptiſme can not be meant. Firſt, becauſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13152:31"/> our ſauiour Chriſt ſpake there to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who knew nothing of the principles of religion, and therefore Chriſt teacheth him, that we haue not in our ſelues any thing to worke our ſaluation, but wee muſt be borne anew. It is vnlikely that our ſauiour Chriſt would inſtruct him of the neceſſitie of baptiſme, who as yet neuer knewe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which in baptiſme are ſealed vp vnto vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin"> Verſe 6.</note> Chriſt going about afterwardes to explane his meaning, in the next verſe maketh mention of the ſpirite onely, and not of the water, whereas if he had ſpoken of baptiſme, and had made it of ſuch abſolute neceſſitie, that in no caſe a man might be ſaued without it, hee would not haue left it out in that place, eſpecially where hee ſheweth how we are borne anew. Thirdly, that which is done in the ſacramentall water, may very well be perceiued both of them that feele it, and of them that ſee it, or heare it: but this new birth that is ſpoken of in that place, how it is wrought a man can not perceiue, as our ſauiour Chriſt telleth vs: Therefore by likelihoode,<note place="margin"> Verſe 8.</note> not the water of baptiſme is there ſpoken of, but that water which God promiſeth by his Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and is called,<note place="margin"> Ezec. 36.24.</note> the cleane water, becauſe of that notable cleanſing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, which no materiall water, be it neuer ſo excellent can worke, but onely Gods cleanſing ſpirit, that is, <hi>The cleane water</hi> there ſpoken of.

But of the laying on of hands there is no mention, vnleſſe you will ſay, that he that giueth him a blow vpon the eare, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hands vpon his head. And as for that it is reckoned among the ceremonies that are not of the ſubſtance of this ſacrament. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in another place ſaith,<note place="margin"> De effec.

But that is not ſo: for the laying on of hands was done vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:13152:34"/> head, and was borowed from the olde lawe, of that which they did vnto the ſacrifices when they brought them to bee offered, they did by that ceremonie of laying their hands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the ſacrifice, conſecrate (as it were) the ſame to the Lord.<note place="margin"> Num. 27, 24</note> And when God commaunded <hi>Moſes</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate <hi>Ioſue</hi> to ſucceed him, and to comfort and incourage him to the worke that he had to doe, he doth lay his handes vpon his head.<note place="margin"> Mat. 19, 16 Acts 6.6 1.

The Biſhop doth croſſe the partie to be confirmed, in the forehead, therefore he layeth hands vpon his head. Well then, this their ſacrament hath no promiſe (as I haue ſhewed) neither hath it any viſible ſigne that was vſed and appointed by Chriſt and the Apoſtles.

Why then I may thus reaſon: A ſacrament muſt haue a promiſe of grace, a viſible or ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne, and a commaundement from God, or elſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſacrament, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth: but confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hath neither promiſe of grace, nor viſible ſigne, nor commaundement from God: therefore it is no ſacrament. Their arguments out of the fathers make a greater ſhew. It is well yet that they cannot preſſe vs but with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of men. Notwithſtanding, this may be briefly ſaid for their authorities from the fathers, that either they are ſuch as haue no writings extant, but onely ſuch ſcraps as they for their owne purpoſe haue gathered togither, and therefore are witneſſes of vs worthily ſuſpected: or, ſuch as haue no ſound credite of any indifferent man: or laſtly, ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13152:34"/> as make nothing for them or againſt vs in this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the Papiſts will haue their Confirmation to bee a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the matter whereof muſt bee Oyle and Balme: but neither doe the moſt learned fathers make mention of the Balme, neither are the Schoole-men agreed amongeſt themſelues, that it is needful for this ſacrament,<note place="margin"> Lib. 2. de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram.

The firſt is this: If theſe words <hi>This is my body,</hi> do proue tranſubſtantiation, then is that doctrine proued by plaine and expreſſe wordes of ſcripture: But, by expreſſe words of ſcripture that doctrine cannot be proued, therfore that place proueth not Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation: The truth of the firſt propoſition is apparant, becauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the plaine and literall ſenſe of theſe wordes prooue
<pb facs="tcp:13152:37"/> that doctrine, or elſe it is not proued therby. And the <hi>minor</hi> or <hi>2.</hi> propoſition is not mine, but it is the words of <hi>Mel. Canus</hi> a learned Papiſt &amp; of D. <hi>Chadſy.</hi>

The firſt propoſition is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> (as I haue ſayd) and therefore I neede not proue it. That ſo to expound the wordes, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation ſhould be proued out of it, is to make Chriſt ſpeake very obſcurely and doubtfully, appeareth by their manifeſt wringing and wreſting of the place.

                        <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can heare it.</hi> For, if they could not abide to heare our Sauiour Chriſt ſay, they muſt eate his fleſh, and drinke his blood, howe much leſſe woulde they not onely haue heard this ſaide againe, but alſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſit at the Table, and hauing taken bread into his hand, to pronounce that that bread was his naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that was borne of the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and that they muſt ſo eate him? But they knew, that about Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſacramentall ſpeaches are to be vſed. And neuer imagined that becauſe he ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> therefore that bread ſhould bee chaunged in ſubſtaunce to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt, no more than there ſhould be an alteration
<pb facs="tcp:13152:38"/> in Chriſt, becauſe he ſayth, <hi>I am the doore, I am the vine,</hi> yea no more than the cup it ſelfe was changed in the words of conſecration, into another thing. They knew, that it is not ſuch a kinde of ſpeach, as is vſed when God is purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make any thing:<note place="margin"> Gen. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Let there be light: let there be a firmament.</hi> It is not a ſpeach of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding, but of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or declaring, when he ſayth: <hi>This is my body.</hi> And therefore they made no ſuch doubts, they did not ſo much as aſke any queſtion how it could bee, that he whoſe bodie they ſaw ſitting with them at the table, could haue alſo an other bodie, though inuiſible, yet a verie true and naturall bodie, hidden in thoſe formes of bread. And as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did neuer imagine ſo groſly of Chriſt, and ſo abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he had two bodies, the one viſible, the other inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the one ſitting at the table, the other lurking in the formes of bread, but did eate that which Chriſt tooke, brake and gaue to them, that is to ſay, bread: ſo Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doeth flatly call it bread,<note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 11.27 28. de Euchar. li. 1. cap. 14.</note> yea, and that after the words of conſecration. And although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would ſeeme to anſwere this argument, and indeed iuſtly cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the anſwere which is commonly made to it, that it is called bread, not becauſe it is ſo nowe, but becauſe it was ſo: for, (ſayeth hee) it is not needfull that if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that be vſed, yet that ſhould bee vſed alwayes: yet neither will the anſwere that hee beſt liketh of ſerue the turne: For, (ſayeth hee) it is called bread according to the Hebrew phraſe, which calleth all meate by the name of bread. Now, to ſtrike him with his owne weapon, if it bee ſo ſometimes, muſt it ſo ſignifie alwayes? I am ſure maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not ſo ſay, for then ſhall wee doubt what it was that our Sauiour Chriſt tooke for the inſtitution of the Sacrament. And if he dare not ſay, that ſo it muſt bee alwayes, then muſt hee giue better reaſon why heere it ſhould not bee ſo, or elſe wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeue him. Eſpecially ſeeing the Apoſtle immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before, ſpeaking of the inſtitution of the Sacrament,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13152:38"/> hath ſhewed howe our Sauiour Chriſt tooke bread, which I truſt maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will there confeſſe to bee bread in deed, and not other foode: why ſhould hee then without proofe or reaſon, ſay here it is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken, to applie it perchaunce to the foode of the ſoule? Yea, this replie may ſerue for all the anſweres that hee hath to this argument, becauſe it is not inough for him to ſay, ſuch a worde may ſo bee taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but hee muſt prooue that it muſt in this place ſo be taken. Moreouer, if you conſider of that which they call the forme of bread, it is no other in colour, taſte, or faſhion, than it was: it putrifieth and corrupteth as ſoone as when it is not conſecrated. Which to affirme, if it were tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into the bodie of Chriſt, were in my mind abſurd and blaſphemous. Laſtly, we ſee by the practiſe that the godly haue ſometime vſed, that the fathers in the primitiue Church thought not the bread to be tranſubſtantiated: For if they had knowne of any tranſubſtantiation, they woulde not haue burned that which remained of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as <hi>Heſichius,</hi>

Moreouer, hee writeth in that place againſt the heretikes that ſayd, there was another God the father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him that made all things. Nowe he inferreth, if they ſhould ſay true, howe ſhall they knowe that that bread is the bodie of their Lord? Whereby it appeareth, that his purpoſe is here, not to ſhew what is in that bread, but which Lord it repreſenteth vnto them: As the verie next wordes in that ſentence declare, which are theſe, <hi>If they ſay not, that he is the ſonne of him that made the world:</hi> ſo that the chiefeſt force of this reaſon after <hi>Irene</hi> his true meaning, is in this word, <hi>Their Lord.</hi> And beſides, to call the ſigne by the name of that which it ſignifieth, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt, for the ſacrament of the bodie of Chriſt, is verie agreeable vnto the Scriptures: but ſuch maner of ſpeaches are but a weake proofe for tranſubſtantiation.

                        <hi>The bread which he tooke he made his bodie, ſaying: this is my bodie.</hi> A man would thinke this were a very plaine place, but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dealeth falſly herein.

So that this bold queſtion of maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> commeth out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, like a triumph before the conqueſt.

And firſt, it is confeſſed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that that booke is not <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and therefore the father of that booke is vncertaine, but yet wee will not denie it, but anſwere the place, if we can. How the bread is made fleſh, hath beene ſufficiently declared in the anſwer to the former arguments: ſo that all the hardneſſe is in this, howe the bread is chaunged, not in forme, but in nature. Firſt, that is true in reſpect of the vſe that it is put to: For as it is a ſacrament, and repreſenteth vnto vs our nouriſhment in Chriſt: ſo muſt it truely nouriſh our bodies, it beeing chaunged in vs to that ende, and nowe, not the accidents, but the ſubſtaunce of bread, can worke this nouriſhment. And therefore, if wee take nature for ſubſtaunce, it may well ſo be expounded, and agree with that which <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Martyr</hi> ſayeth, as before is ſaide. And admit, that nature doeth here ſignifie ſubſtaunce, let vs ſee what they can prooue by it. They ſay the ſubſtance of the bread ceaſſeth, and is quite taken away: But <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the bread is but chaunged in nature, but ſtill it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth bread you ſee, for hee ſo calleth it. Therefore becauſe he vttereth it in ſuch a maner, it is moſt certaine, that he meaneth not by that worde nature, the ſubſtance of bread, but ſomething elſe. Nature therefore is ſomtime ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the diſpoſition, or for the propertie or vſe of a thing,

Now their chiefe and almoſt onely proofe is taken from tranſubſtantiation: of the vntrueth of which doctrine, I truſt I haue ſpoken ſufficiently in the former chapter.</p>
                     <p>And now therefore, that I may conclude, that if the wicked can not eate the body of Chriſt, vnleſſe the bread be changed into the bodie, as themſelues will confeſſe: then, becauſe there is no ſuch change, therefore the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked eate not his body. But one ſhew of an argument they make out of the ſcriptures:<note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 11.27, 29</note> 
                        <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vnwoorthily, is guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord,</hi> and after, <hi>eateth and drinketh iudgement vnto himſelfe, making no difference of the Lordes bodie.</hi> Out of which place they reaſon to this effect: The wicked or vnworthy receiuers, can not be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, vnleſſe they receiue it: But they are guiltie of them, and receiue iudgement to themſelues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: Therefore they receiue the bodie and blood of the Lord. The <hi>minor</hi> or ſecond propoſition is true, for ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith it. But the firſt is moſt falſe. For although the wicked can not be, neither are partakers of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: yet becauſe they come not to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which was inſtituted of God (to offer and aſſure vs of the heauenly graces) with ſuch reuerence as they ought to do, and in ſuch ſincerity as behoueth them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they accounted (and that woorthily) to deſpiſe the things themſelues that are repreſented by thoſe viſible ſignes. And this is it that <hi>S. Paul</hi> findeth fault with the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13152:44"/> Corinthians: For that by deſpiſing the ſacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, they ſhewed their contempt of the thing ſignified thereby. And therfore <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Ambroſe.</note> ſaith euen vpon theſe words: <hi>Becauſe it is the Lorde, whoſe blood he drinketh in myſtery.</hi> S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Hierome.</note> yeeldeth the reaſon why he is guiltie of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath accounted as vile, the Sacrament</hi> (marke his wordes) <hi>of ſo great a myſterie.</hi> Not therefore are they guiltie becauſe they eate Chriſt, but becauſe (ſaith hee) they deſpiſe the Sacrament of ſo great a myſterie. And <hi>Theophilact</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Theophilact</note> vppon theſe wordes ſaieth, <hi>Hee that receiueth it vnwoorthily, ſhall bee no leſſe guiltie of wickedneſſe, than if hee ſhed the very blood of the Lord.</hi> Where we ſee, that <hi>Theophilact</hi> doth compare the vnworthy receiuing of the holie ſacrament, with the ſhedding of Chriſtes blood, and ſo maketh them two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe things. And therefore, in his iudgement, it is not all one to receiue the Sacrament, and to receiue Chriſt. So that by theſe places it appeareth, that the wicked may bee guiltie of the body and blood of Chriſt, which are by the holy Sacrament repreſented and ſealed vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the faithfull, and yet not receiue the body and blood of Chriſt. Yet by the way, I muſt needs note the falſe dealing of <hi>Andradeus</hi> a popiſh writer, who to make the Apoſtles argument the ſtronger for him, doeth falſifie his wordes.

                        <hi>He that eateth me, ſhall liue through me.</hi> They can not therefore offer a greater diſgrace to our Sauiour Chriſt, than to ſay, that any can receiue him, and yet not be partakers of his heauenly graces. So that whileſt they take vpon them the defence of the wicked in ſome ſort, they ſet themſelues, euen wilfully to reproch the holy one of Iſrael. But if it ſhould be granted to them, that the wicked may eate Chriſt, how, or when wil they agree, what ſhall be done with that body &amp; blood of Chriſt that they ſo eate?

The vſe of a thing (ſaith he) that is permanent, is not the ſubſtance of it: but, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating is the vſe of the ſacrament, which ſacrament is a thing permanent: Therefore the communicating in one or two kindes is not the ſubſtance of it. The whole force of this argument conſiſteth in that which is chiefly in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion amongſt vs, that is, whether the ſacrament is a thing permanent, or not. And we vpon iuſt cauſe deny it. And therefore his argument is a plaine fallacie, called the begging of the thing that is in queſtion, and can bee no ſtrong reaſon againſt vs. By a thing permanent they vnderſtand, that the Euchariſt is not onely a Sacrament (as they ſay their other ſacraments are, and as baptiſme is in reſpect of the vſe and receuing of it) but alſo that it being conſecrated once to be a ſacrament, continueth ſo to bee, whether it be receiued or not. Which opinion they holde ſtiffely for the maintenance of their adoration, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it about. For they teach it ſtill to bee a ſacrament, howſoeuer they vſe it. Out of which abſurde principle hee gathereth this falſe and deteſtable doctrine, that they may change this point of Chriſts inſtitution, as they will.</p>
                     <p>But wee knowing, that the Sacraments are onelie helpes for our infirmities, and inſtituted to ſupply our wants, and that the eating of the bodily foode in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and ſo applying it to the nouriſhment of our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13152:47"/> our bodies, is that which repreſenteth vnto vs moſt liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our receiuing of Chriſt by a true faith, to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſoules: deteſt and deſpiſe thoſe captious and curious ſubtilties whereby the papiſtes doe ſeeke to defend their wonderfull boldneſſe, in changing the very inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in breaking the expreſſe commaundement of Chriſt. Wherein wee haue for our warrant, the worde of Chriſt, which biddeth vs eate and drinke (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can not be but arrogant preſumption for man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that which Chriſt hath commaunded, howſoeuer hee will pretend, that it is not of the ſubſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.) We haue alſo the practiſe in the primitiue church, which is teſtified by <hi>Iſichius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> In Leuit. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> which vſed for to burne that which remained of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: <hi>Origen</hi> alſo reporteth the ſame.

                     <p>Seeing therefore theſe men that would ſeeme pillars in the church of Chriſt, doe picke quarrelles at his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and make exception to his commaundement, and all to writhe their neckes out of his yoke, and to free themſelues from his lawes, like lewd ſeruauntes, which will not frame themſelues to doe that which woulde beſt pleaſe their maiſters, but that onely which they muſt bee forced to doe whether they will or not: let vs nowe ſee how in the ſecond point, they do ſeeke to peruert the verie decree it ſelfe that Chriſt ſet down concerning this matter, to make men beleeue, that hee meant no ſuch thing, as in trueth he did.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of his aſſertion is, that it is not orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the word of God, what ſhall be done in that point. This is an intollerable boldeneſſe. Doth not our ſauiour Chriſt take order, as well for the cup, as for the bread? Doth not he that ſaieth, Take, eate, ſay alſo, Drinke ye
<pb facs="tcp:13152:48"/> all of this? If any man will anſwere as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth in one place,<note place="margin"> De Euchar. lib. 4. cap. 27.</note> that they were not both giuen at one time, and therefore that properly to ſpeake, the Supper of the Lord conſiſteth but of one kind, he ſhould plainly declare, that he hath rather a deſire to contend than to knowe the trueth. For what is it to vs how long time was betweene the one commaundement and the other, ſo that we know, that both the one and the other is inſtituted of Chriſt. Yea the Apoſtle ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> very plainely telleth vs,<note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 11.</note> that the order both for the cup and the bread is deliuered to him of the Lord, <hi>That which I receiued of the Lord, I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto you.</hi> And then hee ſheweth Chriſts inſtitution for the bread and alſo the cup. But with full mouth, and one conſent they tell vs, that that commaundement belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Apoſtles onely, and not to all the diſciples. And yet ſaint <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin"> Math. 26.26</note> he gaue it to his diſciples. Yea, and Chriſt commaundeth, <hi>Drinke yee all of this:</hi> And hath not ſaide concerning the bread, eate ye all of this (although wee deny not, that euery one hauing prooued themſelues ſhould eate of it.) But ſeeing God hath giuen a more expreſſe commaundement vnto all for the cup, than for the bread, why ſhould they rather reſtraine lay men from receiuing the cup, than from the bread? Againe, doeth he not ſay to all them, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> to whome before hee ſaide, <hi>Take eate?</hi> Yes verily, for the text is plaine, both in the Euangeliſts and ſaint <hi>Paule.</hi> But the bread muſt be giuen to al, they confeſſe, therefore why not the cup alſo? And that which ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> wrote concerning the vſe of the Sacrament, it is plaine he wrote vnto all the church of Corinth (not onely by that place which <hi>Kemnitius</hi> alleadgeth,<note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 1.2.</note> 
                        <hi>To all that call vppon the name of the Lorde,</hi> and that hee writeth vnto the church of Corinth,<note place="margin"> De Euchar. lib. 4. cap. 25.</note> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doeth ſeeke to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, rather leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to ſay nothing, than that in truth, he ſaith anie thing worth the ſetting downe) but alſo by the puniſhment that followed the abuſe of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13152:48"/> ſacrament. <hi>For this cauſe many are weake and feeble amongſt you, and many ſleepe.</hi> Which came vpon them, not that did eate of that bread onely, but alſo that drunke of that cup vnworthily. And it cannot be imagined, that either the miniſters were ſo bad at that time ſo generally, that ſo many of them would haue offended therein: or if the fault had beene in them, the Apoſtle would more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly haue reprooued them: neither were they then ſo many in one place, that it could haue beene truely ſaide of them, that many are weake, and many ſleepe, or are dead. Therefore, whereas many were puniſhed amongſt the Corinthians for vnworthily receiuing both the bread and the cup, and this word <hi>(Many)</hi> cannot, as I haue prooued be there referred to their Teachers onely, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that this puniſhment was amongeſt the lay men, as well at the laſt, as amongſt their miniſters: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the lay men in the church of Corinth receiued the cup.</p>
                     <p>And thus much of that wicked aſſertion, wherein they doe affirme, that it is lawfull for the church to alter this part of Chriſtes inſtitution, and alſo to take away the cup.</p>
                     <p>Nowe to a ſecond, and as wicked a propoſition as the other. Wherein they teach, that it is needeleſſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in both kindes. And to prooue this, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome paines in three whole chapters.<note place="margin"> De Euch. lib. 4. cap. 21, 22, 23</note> In the firſt two he ſheweth, that the whole ſacrament may be receiued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kinde: and therefore in the laſt hee teacheth, that no more good is to be gotten of the ſacrament vnder both kindes, than vnder one. And although we can not allowe of that concomitance, as it is termed, that is, that inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable coniunction of the body and blood vnder either of the ſignes, which eſpecially hee prooueth in the firſt chapter of thoſe three, namely, the one and twentieth, that the whole ſubſtance of a ſacrament is found in either kinde, as hee
<pb facs="tcp:13152:49"/> teacheth in the two and twentieth chapter: yet if we ſhould grant thoſe two points, that which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would conclude in the three and twentieth chapter can not follow. For what if Chriſt may bee wholy receiued vnder one kinde? Yet it ſhould not follow, that vnder one as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually he may be receiued, as vnder both. For, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhewed, his death is more liuely repreſented by the bread, and his bloudſheding by the wine. And that which more effectually repreſenteth it, is more profitable than that which leſſe repreſenteth the ſame. And it is too much ſawcineſſe ſo to controll the wiſedome of God, that when hee ſaith, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> which is a plaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, any fooliſh man dare ſay: It is to no profite: it can do you no good. As for the cauſes that are alleaged by <hi>Gerſon</hi> and other, why the popiſh church thought good to take away the cup from the lay people, they are ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and friuolous, that a man would think rather that they ieſted, than ſpake in earneſt. But what cauſe ſoeuer man can pretend to alter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which Chriſt hath ordained, it doth but teſtifie, that he thought not Chriſt wiſe enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ſuch inconueniences, as hee by his wiſedome hath prouided for.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therfore the church cannot forbid that that God commaundeth (whatſoeuer cauſes they will pretend, and if they might, yet the cauſes ſet downe by the Romiſh church, either are blaſphemous, or at the leaſt friuolous) it is a ſure way for vs, rather to regard gods holy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and follow the inſtitution of our ſauiour Chriſt, than to follow any the deuiſes of man. And when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, drinke you all of this, it is a great ſinne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerueth Gods wrath, for any man to anſwer, I will not receiue the cup, becauſe the Pope and the Popiſh church of late hath forbidden it.</p>

                        <hi>and his bloud in forme of wine, for a ſacrifice.</hi> Firſt, his firſt propoſition is not ſimplie true, but onely inaſmuch as the one muſt be figured of the other. But in what things <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> is a figure of Chriſt, none can better tell than the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes, who ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handleth that matter,<note place="margin"> Col. cum Tryph. fol. 36</note> and yet doth not once mention this ſacrifice. And therefore we may gather, that <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> was no figure of Chriſt in that point: For if he was, then was not the Apoſtle faithfull to omit ſo neceſſarie a point. <hi>Iuſtin</hi> alſo hath a notable compariſon of them, but he doth not touch that in one worde. Secondly, a ſacrifice muſt be offered: but this bread and wine was but brought foorth for ſo doth their owne tranſlation teſtifie. Thirdly, a ſacrifice muſt be offered to God: this place mentioneth no ſuch thing, and therefore moſt likely that it was brought to refreſh <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſouldiers. Whereby we ſee, that <hi>Bellarmines <hi>minor</hi>
                        </hi> hath no truth in it, wherein he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> offred bread and wine to God in ſacrifice. Laſtly, what a conſequence is this: <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> offered to God bread and wine in ſacrifice: therefore Chriſt offered himſelfe in forme of bread and wine. Rather is this a ſtrong argument to the contrarie, if wee ſhould graunt that he did offer the bread and wine to God, which hath no probabilitie in it: But I ſay, if that ſhould be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wee might thus reaſon: The thing figured muſt bee like to the figure: but <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> who was the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, offered but bread and wine, therefore Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered nothing elſe but bread and wine: and ſo maketh it nothing for that ſacrifice, for which the Papiſts doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it.</p>

                     <p> As for his teſtimonies out of the fathers, for proofe of <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> offering of bread and wine to God in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, becauſe I purpoſe eſpecially to goe through his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall arguments, I omit of purpoſe a particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euerie place, onely contenting my ſelfe with this generall obſeruation, that out of the teſtimonies alledged hee can hardly conclude that which hee taketh in hande to prooue, becauſe the fathers ſeeme rather to allude ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times vnto that which he did, than ſo to alledge his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that they thinke anie neceſſarie argument for proofe hereof, is to be gathered out of the ſame. And that may wel be gathered out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> vpon this place, who ſaith thus:<note place="margin"> In Gen. hom. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>For the honor that he ſhewed to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke, ſee how a ſacrament is inſinuated: For he offred to him bread and wine.</hi> Marke <hi>(to him)</hi> that is, to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> flat againſt that which they would. And this is moſt agreeable vnto the hyſtorie written by <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> who by all likelihood knew beſt in his time how that ſtorie was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderſtood,<note place="margin"> Ant. li. 1. c. 18</note> he ſaith that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> gaue great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment vnto the ſouldiers of <hi>Abraham,</hi> And ſo <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> in the place alledged ſaith, <hi>Abraham</hi> brought forth loaues and wine. And thus doth the Chaldee Paraphraſe expound it: So that if we rightly conſider, not onely what they ſay, but how they ſpeake it, and vpon what ground, to anſwer whatſoeuer he can bring out of the fathers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point, will not be hard.</p>

                        <note place="margin">de Miſſa. lib. 1. cap 7.</note> But, <hi>the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer was a kinde of offering of a ſacrifice to God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Euchariſt muſt ſo be.</hi> Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath forgotten what he ſhould proue: hee muſt teach Chriſt to be in his laſt ſupper a ſacrifice properly ſo called: but this argument proueth the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be a kinde of ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>This argument, to be ſhort, is thus anſwered: There were two things in the Paſſeouer: The one was, the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, by which was Chriſts death repreſented vnto
<pb facs="tcp:13152:51"/> vs, as <hi>Iuſtine Martir</hi> that ancient father teacheth, <hi>Dialog. cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tryph. Iudaeo.</hi> The other was, the eating of it, by which was figured vnto them that ſpirituall foode of the ſoule Chriſt Ieſus, who was promiſed vnto their fathers. And in this reſpect may it in ſome ſort bee called a figure of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> becauſe it repreſented vnto them that thing, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> repreſenteth vnto vs. Therfore, if in the firſt propoſition. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> meaneth by celebrating the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the eating of the Paſſeouer, I graunt it, but then is his <hi>minor</hi> or ſecond propoſition vntrue: For the eating of it was not the killing of it, and ſo not a ſacrifice. But if by the celebrating of the Paſſeouer, he vnderſtand the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, then is his <hi>maior</hi> to be denied, becauſe in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> is no killing, or ſhedding of bloud. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, a man may thus reaſon: The celebrating of the Paſſeouer was not in euerie reſpect a figure of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt:</hi> For the Paſſeouer muſt haue <hi>the ſprinkling of blood</hi> which might not be ſprinkled but by the Prieſt only: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>2. Chron. 30.16.</hi> where that ſolemne keeping of the Paſſeouer, by king <hi>Ezechiah</hi> is deſcribed: and <hi>2. Chron. 35.11.</hi> where it is declared, how zealouſly <hi>Ioſiah</hi> performed the ſame ſeruice. And in that reſpect onely is it to be counted a Sacrifice: for that onely belonged to the Prieſts to doe, ſo as no other but the Prieſts might doe it. All other things might be, and were performed by others: But the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> they all with full mouth, confeſſe to bee vnbloodie: and therefore in this thing wherein onely the Paſcall Lambe may be accounted a ſacrifice, it is no figure of the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> So the celebrating of the Paſſeouer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that point wherein it is a ſacrifice, doeth nothing proue that ſacrifice which the Romiſh church would teach in the Maſſe. And ſee how vnneceſſarie an argument this is: In the celebrating of the Paſſeouer, there was a bloody ſacrifice: therefore in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> muſt bee a bloodie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. This conſequence the Papiſts themſelues will not graunt: and yet it is as good and neceſſarie as that of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13152:51"/> theirs. In celebrating of the Paſchall Lambe there was a ſacrifice: therefore in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> there muſt bee a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. For this principle that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doeth ſet downe, <hi>That celebrating of the Paſſeouer, was en ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe figure of the Euchariſt:</hi> if it proue the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to haue a ſacrifice, it doth alſo proue it to haue a bloodie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: for otherwiſe the Lambe or Paſſeouer was not an expreſſe figure of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> If therefore the Papiſts will denie that it is a bloudy ſacrifice, why ſhould we grant it to bee a ſacrifice, vnleſſe they can alledge better reaſon than this that is taken from celebrating the Paſſeouer. And thus much for the ſecond argument.</p>

Out of which he will proue that it muſt bee a new ſacrifice, and ſuch as was not before: but our ſpirituall ſacrifices haue beene alwayes, therefore the Prophet cannot meane of our ſpirituall ſacrifices. It will neuer be proued that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh of ſuch a ſacrifice as neuer was. But the Iewes truſted too much in their externall Sacrifices: yea, though they were not ſuch as God commaunded that they ſhould be. But on the contrarie, God telleth them, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen among the Gentiles whom they deſpiſed, thinking that no good could be amongſt them, I ſay, among them ſhould be offered, not ſuch polluted and vncleane things, as the Prieſts were content to take of the Iewes to offer to God, but a <hi>Cleane offering:</hi> euen ſuch an offering as was the bodie of their ſhadowes, the truth of their figures, and the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their ceremonies, in reſpect of him that brought the offering: that is, they ſhould ſerue the Lord with a ſincere and ſingle heart. And this is the cleane ſacriffce that <hi>Malachie</hi> meaneth, which was acceptable alwayes, and alwayes ſhall be. Fourthly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> imagineth, that God by <hi>Malachy</hi> ſetteth the contempt and diſhonouring of God, done by the Leuiticall Prieſts againſt the honour that he ſhall haue among the Gentiles.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13152:53"/> is greater than the honour done by the Gentiles: I denie his conſequence: for, they diſhonored God but in a corner of the world, but the Gentiles worſhipped him from the riſing of the Sunne, to the going downe of the ſame: and herein ſtandeth the force of the compariſon, as by the wordes plainely appeareth. Fifthly, he ſuppoſeth that the Prieſtes of the olde lawe, are compared with the Prieſtes in the Goſpel, but there is no ſuch matter, as the wordes declare. But to wring and force wordes, to ſee what may be gathered out of them, rather than to ſearch what their true meaning is, doth bring but ſmall credite to their cauſe, and weake proofe to their doctrine. His laſt argument to prooue this place of <hi>Malachie</hi> not to belong to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſacrifice, is out of the fathers, where, in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee ſheweth his weakeneſſe, more than in his other reaſons, or elſe a worſe humour. For although that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus Martyr</hi> whom hee firſt alledgeth,<note place="margin"> Col. cum Tryph. Iudaeo.</note> doeth in trueth affirme, and wee denie it not, that <hi>Malachie</hi> ſayeth that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a ſacrifice, yet that hee ſpeaketh not of a ſacrifice properly ſo called, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, except he ſpeake agaynſt his owne conſcience, if hee conſider what hee ſayeth long after in that booke: namely, that <hi>Euerie one that is called by the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, are in deede made Prieſts to God, as God doth teſtifie, ſaying: In euerie place cleane and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſacrifices ſhall bee offered.</hi> Which ſacrifices alſo what they are, he afterwards teſtifieth, prayers and thanks giuings. What can be more plaine? But this eſpecially is to be remembred, that not Prieſts only, but euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth by <hi>Iuſtines</hi> wordes, offer vp theſe cleane offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and therefore that hee ſpeaketh of ſpirituall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. <hi>Irene</hi> his ſecond witneſſe, maketh little for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for euen immediately before the words whereby <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> woulde prooue the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to bee a ſacrifice, after the proper ſignification of the worde, hee ſheweth that God hath no delight in ſacrifices or burnt offerings, but in <hi>Faith, obedience, and righteouſnes.</hi> And after, <hi>that
<pb facs="tcp:13152:54"/> he taught his diſciples to offer to God the firſt fruits out of his creatures,</hi>

                        <hi>not that hee needed any thing, but that they ſhould neither be vnfruitful, nor vnthankfull. And ſo he tooke bread, and gaue thanks, and eat,</hi> as is by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledged. Can any thing be more plaine? He firſt ſheweth that God regardeth not thoſe reall ſacrifices, that I may ſo terme them: then he ſheweth, that the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> is a ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing. And as in the words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> it is an offering of the firſt fruits of his gifts,<note place="margin"> Cap. 33.</note> that giueth vs our nouriſhment, and in the next chapter he expoundeth the incenſe (ſo alledging the wordes of <hi>Malachie, In euerie place incenſe ſhalbe offered vp</hi>) by that place of the Apocalips,<note place="margin"> Apoc. 5.8</note> 
                        <hi>that the incenſe was the prayer of the Saints:</hi> ſo we ſee that prayers and praiſes are the ſacrifices that he ſpeaketh of, &amp; theſe are ſpiritual, and not reall ſacrifices. And as for <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Tertul.</note> whom in the <hi>3.</hi> place he bringeth forth: as he hath nothing for him in the place by him alledged,<note place="margin"> Tert. cont.

But the place of <hi>Tertullian</hi> plainly ſheweth the vntruth of his anſwere: for <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh thus: <hi>In euerie place a ſacrifice ſhal be offered in my name, and a cleane ſacrifice, euen ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere prayer out of a pure heart.</hi> So that <hi>Tertullian</hi> did not ſo much as dreame of any incenſe there: and it is ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that it muſt needes expound how he vnderſtandeth that cleane ſacrifice ſpoken of by <hi>Malachie.</hi> The next commeth in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who ſaieth, <hi>That the olde ſacrifice is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and the new celebrated: and then</hi> (ſayeth <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) he citeth this place of Malachie.</hi>

For if he could proue that Chriſt did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe in his laſt ſupper to God the father, we would eaſily confeſſe it to be a ſacrifice true and proper. So that on the contrary, I may as well reaſon thus: Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing to be don, but that which himſelf did in his laſt ſupper: but himſelfe did not ſacrifice: and therfore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded no ſacrifice in the laſt ſupper. Wel, his firſt proof of this vntrue propoſition, is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath ſaid of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> the paſchal Lambe, &amp; the blood of the couenant, of which I truſt I haue ſpoken ſufficiently, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man, in my anſwer to his <hi>3.</hi> firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall arguments.<note place="margin"> Luke 22.19 20 1 Cor. 11.24</note> His ſecond reaſon is this: Theſe words, <hi>Is giuen, is broken, is ſhed,</hi> which are words of the preſent time, do ſignifie that he was giuen, broken, &amp; ſhed vnto god for a ſacrifice. M. <hi>Bellar.</hi> ſeemeth to me to be hopſhakled, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not wel ſtep forward.

And yet his propoſition that he ſhould prooue, and his reaſon whereby hee doeth it, are all one. But if hee ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe wordes, <hi>Is giuen, broken, and ſhedde,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an act that then was done, and therefore done in the Supper: what will hee ſay to their owne tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which tranſlateth, <hi>Shall bee ſhed,</hi> in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> alſo, and alſo of the bread, <hi>This is my bodie, which ſhalbe giuen for you.</hi> It ſeemeth when that tranſlation was firſt ſet foorth, that peece of ſcripture was not ſo taken as it is now: but that thoſe words of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,<note place="margin"> Math. 26.28 mar. 14.24 luk. 22.20 1. cor. 11.24</note> were taken for a promiſe of that which Chriſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the next day, as in truth they were. I but maſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> telleth vs, that al theſe readings are good, becauſe there may be a good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of either of them. I confeſſe that to be true: and therfore M. <hi>Bellarmins</hi> reaſon is not ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, whoſe force hangeth vpon theſe wordes onely, which may well be tranſlated otherwiſe. But by the way, what if I ſhould thus reaſon? A repreſentatiue ſacrifice is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie ſacrifice: but Chriſts ſacrifice that in his ſupper hee offred vnto God, was repreſentatiue, ſaieth <hi>Bellarm.</hi> in this place, therefore not propitiatorie, and much leſſe then is the Maſſe a propitiatorie ſacrifice: Neither do I ſee to what end Chriſt ſhould repreſent to God the ſheding of his bloud, which ſhould be afterwards vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, although M. <hi>Bellar</hi> doth ſay it: becauſe he is loth to tell the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (which I haue alreadie touched) why their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tranſlation did not preciſely follow the Greeke in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of theſe words, <hi>ſhalbe giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, broken, ſhed.</hi> His third reaſon out of the words of the inſtitution. to proue his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is as ſtrong as the ſecond, and is this: <hi>Breaking</hi> cannot be ſpoken wel of the bodie, and in this place <hi>(which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you)</hi> cannot be true of the bread, for the bread is not broken for vs: therefore it muſt be vnderſtoode of Chriſts bodie in forme of bread. In this argument M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiecteth their vulgar tranſlation which ſomtime he and his

                        <note place="margin"> Rhem. Teſt. De miſſa li. 1 cap. 14</note>But in the tenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths, which the Papiſts make their ſtrong bulwarke, maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> findeth three arguments. His firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this, <hi>Euerie altar which in deed is an altar, is builded for offering of ſacrifices: But the Lords table af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort is an altar: therefore it is for offering of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi> We will not ſtriue with maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> much for this point: for we will confeſſe that ſuch ſacrifices are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the altar, as maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar to be. <hi>The Lordes table</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a kinde of altar, or an altar after a ſort:</hi> So we ſay, that ſacrifices after a ſort, namely ſpirituall ſacrifices, are offered thereupon. His ſecond reaſon out of this place, is a lowde lie: For thus hee ſaith: <hi>For the Apoſtle ſpeaketh plainly, that we that are faithfull, doe ſo receyue the bodie and blood of the Lord, at the table of the Lord, as the Iewes their ſacrifices, or the Gentiles their meates offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, on their altars or tables.</hi> And becauſe hee cannot proue this to bee true, you muſt truſt him of his owne worde, for he bringeth no proofe at all. Let the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reader peruſe the place, and marke his falſe dealing with it. The wordes cited by him, begin at the <hi>14.</hi> verſe of that Chapter, and continue vnto the <hi>22.</hi> the ſumme whereof is this, as they that conſider the place may ſee: As by participating at the Lords table, you are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt, and ioyned togither, amongſt your ſelues in one bodie, verſe <hi>16, 17:</hi> ſo by participating at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Idols, you are made partakers of them, and ioyned in fellowſhip with the Idolaters. But that which he telleth vs, is ſo plaine in theſe wordes, cannot be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of them. And this alſo is a ſufficient anſwere to his thirde argument that hee wringeth out of theſe wordes. Whereby he will force Saint <hi>Paule</hi> whether hee will or not, to finde out an offering in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:13152:57"/> becauſe he ſaith, they that eate the offrings, are partakers of the altar. Out of which place, as hee cannot probably conclude any thing to proue a ſacrifice in the euchariſt, ſo hee plainely proclaimeth, that if it ſhould be proued, that their maſſe were a ſacrifice, yet the prieſt only is the better for it, becauſe the prieſt onlie eateth vp all. For, <hi>They that eate the offrings, are partakers of the Altar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of proofes which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is gathered out of the fathers.<note place="margin"> Lib. 1. de miſſa cap. 6.</note> And the firſt argument of that ſort, is drawen from the wordes of ſacrifice, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing, offering, oblation and ſuch like.<note place="margin"> Chap. 15.</note> Why the fathers vſe thus to ſpeake of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> I haue ſhewed a little before in the anſwere to his ſixte argument. But nowe <hi>maiſter Bellarmine</hi> proueth, that a ſacrifice may be both commemoratiue, and repreſent an other thing, as did the ſacrifices in the Leuiticall law, and alſo be a true ſacrifice indeede, which is moſt true: and thereupon concludeth, that this ſacrifice repreſentatiue in the euchariſt is alſo a true ſacrifice. But this his argument hath no neceſſarie conſequence: for, the Leuiticall ſacrifice muſt needes be a ſacrifice truely ſo called, that by the death of the beaſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, and by the ſhedding of that blood, the death &amp; blod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding of Chriſt, might be the more liuely repreſented to the faithfull, and more conſtantly beleeued of them, which thing being in trueth perfourmed, and Chriſt Ieſus the true facrifice indeede being offered,<note place="margin"> Heb. 10.26</note> 
                        <hi>There remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinne</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreouer, in thoſe ſacrifices, that they might bee knowen to be ſacrifices inſtituted and appointed of God, we ſee how the thing ſacrificed, the manner of ſacrificing, and all the circumſtances are plainely ſet downe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by God: And on the contrary, in this ſacrifice which they ſeeke to maintaine, all things are obſcure: not ſo much as a probable ſhew of any commaundement, or of any inſtitution of a ſacrifice: Therefore the Iewiſh ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice can be no proofe for the ſacrifice of the maſſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:13152:58"/> he will prooue, that in the euchariſt, is not only a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatiue ſacrifice, becauſe the fathers ſpeake ſometimes of oblations and ſacrifices in the plural number, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are more ſacrifices than that one repreſentatiue: but he taketh more paines then he needeth, for we teach that beſides the repreſentation of Chriſts ſacrifice, we offer in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the ſacrifices of prayers, prayſes, and ſuch like ſpirituall oblations.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, baptiſme, ſaith hee, is a ſacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Chriſtes death, but is not called of any of the fathers, a ſacrifice offered to God: therefore the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentation of Chriſts death and bloudſhedding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> be called a ſacrifice. For baptiſme, it repreſenteth vnto vs the efficacy and vertue of Chriſtes death, rather than the death it ſelfe: So that there is great difference betweene theſe two ſacraments. For the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords ſupper repreſenteth the ſacrifice it ſelfe which he vpon the croſſe did offer, euen the tormenting and mangling of his body, &amp; the ſhedding of his bloud. So that there is much more cauſe why the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſacrifice, than baptiſme. Fourthly, M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> imagineth, that if it were not indeed a very proper ſacrifice, we might in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ſay to God truely, <hi>I offer to thee this gift, accept Lord this ſacrifice.</hi> And moreouer he chargeth vs that we doe wholy abſtaine from ſuch wordes, and greatly reproue them for vſing of them. And yet in one ſhort praier vſed after the receiuing of the communion with vs, we pray thus, <hi>Accept this our ſacrifice of praiſe &amp; thankeſgiuing.</hi> And after, <hi>We offer and preſent vnto thee o Lord our ſelues, our ſoules &amp; bodies, to be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, holy, &amp; liuely ſacrifice to thee.</hi> Which wordes doe not only anſwere the ſlaunder wherewith he vniuſtlie chargeth our churches, but alſo ſheweth that well we maie vſe thoſe words, <hi>I offer to thee this gift, accept Lord this ſacrifice,</hi> although we take not vpon vs to offer Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> As for the hyperbolicall ſpeeches,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13152:58"/> which the fathers vſe ſometimes, which is his firſt reaſon, we learne thereby rather with howe reuerent an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſhoulde come to theſe ſacramentes, than what wee ſhoulde thinke the thinges themſelues to be. For howe can it els bee true that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe out of the Greeke fathers alleadgeth, that they call it a ſacrifice terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of horrour, which cannot be properly verified of the ſacrifice propitiatorie which they woulde haue it to bee, for that muſt needes bee ſweete and comfortable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: in it is only grace and mercy, no horrour, no ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, becauſe the fathers acknowledge in this ſacrifice of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that there is that honor performed, which is due to God only, therefore woulde maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> conclude, that it muſt needs be more than a ſacrifice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. And we doe eaſily yeeld vnto him, that it is alſo called a ſacrifice, of the fathers, yea &amp; of vs alſo, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſpirituall ſacrifices therein offered. And this yet muſt be noted, that properly to ſpeake of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> it is but a ſacrament: But in the reſpectes aforeſaide,<note place="margin"> De miſſa li. 1. cap. 16.</note> it is ſometime called, yet vnproperly a ſacrifice. But ſaith maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the fathers make mention of an altar: therefore they alſo proue thereby that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a ſacrifice: for there is no Altar, but in reſpect of a reall ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>But the firſt altars were but tables of wood, not altars of ſtone, ſuch as are now for the popiſh ſacrifice, in theſe daies commaunded: and theſe altars of worde they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about from place to place, as occaſion ſerued: and therfore, although the names of altars be found in the moſt ancient fathers almoſt that are, yet popiſh altars are not thereby proued, neither were there any altars of ſtone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of <hi>Silueſter,</hi> who liued more than three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Chriſt: For hee firſt commaunded that ſtone altars ſhould be made, as their freind <hi>Gerſon</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: And therefore as they call it ſometime an altar,
<pb facs="tcp:13152:59"/> ſo ſometime they call it a Table,<note place="margin"> Lib. 4. cont. Floratum. De conſecrat. diſt. 1. cap. Nemo</note> as doeth <hi>Clement,</hi> who they ſay was one of the firſt biſhops of Rome, he twice within few wordes mentioneth the Lords Table. If therefore it be a good argument thus to reaſon: The fathers do ſometime mention an altare for the euchariſt: therefore they thought it was a ſacrifice, for there needeth no altar but for a ſacrifice. I am ſure this is as good an argument: Somtime they ſpeake of a table for the eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt as out of <hi>Athanaſius, Theodoret, Auguſtine,</hi> this <hi>Clement,</hi> and others, is moſt plaine: and therefore they thought it not to be a ſacrifice, for, there is no ſacrifice vpon a table, but onely vpon an altar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin"> De miſſa lib. 1. cap. 17.</note>Yet maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> roueth againe with his vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proofes. The fathers (ſaieth hee) ſpeake of prieſts, therefore they will haue a ſacrifice in the euchariſt. And why may not the fathers vnderſtand prieſts as wee doe in our booke of making of miniſters, and in our booke of common prayer, who ſucceede in the publike miniſtery in the church the prieſts of <hi>Leui,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Leuit. 10.11. Deut. 17.5. mal. 2.7.</note> not in ſacrificing, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices are ended, but in teaching: for that was alſo the prieſts office, and is now the office of them that we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time call prieſts. And yet we, although we vſe the name, do not alow that popiſh ſacrifice, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue. And why then ſhould this be holden for a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The fathers ſpeake ſometimes of prieſts: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the euchariſt is a reall ſacrifice, or a ſacrifice after the proper ſignification of that word. As for that which hee hath in the eighteenth chapter of that his firſt booke of the maſſe, is almoſt all one with that which hee ſaide in the fifteenth chapter, and therefore it is anſwered before. But his laſt proofe,<note place="margin"> Chap. 19</note> whereby hee will out of the fathers prooue a ſacrifice, is, as himſelfe ſaith, vnanſwerable, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we do vtterly reiect the fathers. The fathers deſire not to be credited againſt the trueth. They were men, they might erre. Onely Gods word is perfectly true. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as wee do them no wrong, to trie and examine their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13152:59"/> doctrine by that rule and ſquare that cannot deceiue:<note place="margin"> How the fathers are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> ſo if it be not agreeable to that word of trueth, wee muſt rather confeſſe all men to be liars, than ſwarue one iote from that perfect way. And therefore it is not abſurd, if wee leaue the fathers, when they goe without their guide of Gods written word, or ſpeake without their warrant of Gods infallible trueth. So that although wee are content, to ſhew how the fathers wreſted by them, either muſt or may be vnderſtoode, that by that meanes wee may pull from them that viſard of antiquitie &amp; conſent of fathers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they cloke and colour their dangerous and deceitfull hereſies, yet we receiue the fathers but as men, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maſters to giue vs new lawes, but yet men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts in their time, and alwayes worthy of much reuerence and honour. But yet this is not a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The fathers haue ſomctime written this, or haue done this: Therefore it is true, or it is good. But let vs view his vnanſwerable argument: If the euchariſt were not a ſacrifice, the fathers would not haue offred the ſame, for peace, ſafety, and ſundry ſuch things: but they did: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a ſacrifice. Marke howe hee prooueth that they did offer the euchariſt for ſuch things. Hee firſt alleageth <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his homilies to the people of Antioch,<note place="margin"> Hom. 79. Hom. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> .</note> and then alſo vpon <hi>Mathew,</hi> moſt notably belying that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as though he ſpake thereof the ſacrifice in the eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, whereas the firſt whole Homily is altogether of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> there ſheweth, that they pray in deed for the whole world, and for ſundry perſons: but of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the altar, not a word: And therefore maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> belieth that father. And in the ſecond place, <hi>Wee pray firſt for them that are poſſeſſed, the ſecond, for the penitent, &amp;c.</hi> Is this good dealing to auouch, that that ancient father ſaith in thoſe places, that the Euchariſt was offered for ſuch things. Other falſifications of theſe very places I omit, as not much materiall.</p>
                     <p>When I heard his great cracke, I imagined this ſhot
<pb facs="tcp:13152:60"/> would haue made a great breach, but it is like to doe no hurt at all. Then, for that which he alleageth out of ſame <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was offered by one for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certaine houſe from euill ſpirites.<note place="margin"> De ciuit. Dei lib. 22. cap. 8.</note> It is true that he reporteth ſuch a thing, and addeth, <hi>That hee prayed as earneſtly as he could, that that vexation might ceaſe.</hi> Firſt, it is not ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe that doth this, but another: and this fact is not either commended or allowed to be wel done of ſaint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But they wil anſwere, The euill ſpirits left the houſe: And therefore the euent prooueth the fact to be good. Not ſo: but it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods might and mercie, that can and will by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, or the abuſe of good meanes, bring to paſſe good things. Secondly, it may iuſtly be doubted, whether ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did impute this effect vnto that ſacrifice that he ſpeaketh of, or the earneſt prayers that were made for it. Yea it ſeemeth rather that he imputeth it vnto the ſacrifice of prayer, than any other ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer it ſeemeth, that as in the dayes of ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> there were that were baptized ouer the dead, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their hope of the reſurrection, or to teſtify their dying vnto ſinne, or for ſuch other conſiderations: ſo in theſe dayes of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſome, vpon ſuch occaſions would celebrate the ſacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, by that aſſurance and pledge of Gods loue, to ſtirre vp and confyrme their faith, that with more earneſtneſſe and faith they might craue Gods helpe. But if maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue this to be a catholike doctrine, that hath but one or few examples, he will haue <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> flat contrary to him.<note place="margin"> Confeſſ. li. 9. cap. 12.</note> So that alſo that is alleaged of the oblation for his mother: it can not bee denied, that there were at that time ſome ſuch abuſes creeping into the church of God, concerning that charitable ſuperſtition, that I may ſo terme it, of prayer for the dead, of the which ſome had good liking, ſome liked not. But out of them it is hard to eſtabliſh a ſtrange doctrine in Gods church, and ſuch as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13152:60"/> Gods word is not acquainted withall. But euen by that booke of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> it is plaine, and namely by the next chapter to the place alleadged, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> did not once thinke of any propitiatory ſacrifice that was in the maſſe. And I would alſo deſire the indifferent Reader to iudge how litle ſuch matters ſauour of the maieſtie of that ſpirit, which is ſeene in the ſcriptures. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> laſt ſort of arguments are drawen from reaſon: The firſt is grounded vpon this principle,<note place="margin"> De miſſa lib. 1. cap. 20.</note> there is no religion without an externall ſacrifice: which is moſt falſe, for God when he ſeeth his people to whom he commanded thoſe external ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, to repoſe themſelues too much vpon them, doeth not onely reiect thoſe ſacrifices which himſelfe appointed, but alſo teacheth wherein true religion conſiſts, <hi>Iſa 1.15, 16.</hi> and <hi>Mich. 6.8.</hi> Yea, marke the whole ſcriptures &amp; it wil appeare, that faith &amp; obedience are the eſpeciall things that god requireth of vs, &amp; that the ſacrifices directed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. His ſecond argument taken from reaſon is this: The Iewes had ſuch ſacrifices: therefore wee muſt haue them.<note place="margin"> Chap. 21.</note> If this argument be denied, he can neuer prooue it. For the Iewes had thoſe ceremonies and rudiments of the world, becauſe they were in their nonage,<note place="margin"> Galat. 4.3.</note> and Chriſt was not yet come, and ſo the reuelation of Chriſt, was not then ſo plaine as now it is: therefore they needed thoſe things, but we do not. And moreouer, if theſe ſacrifices were ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as they affirme them to be, as that there is no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without them, &amp; of neceſſity we muſt haue them, then were the Apoſtles too blame, who giuing direction to the Gentiles what were neceſſary for them,<note place="margin"> Acts 15.19.20.</note> neuer warned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this externall ſacrifice. For ſeeing there was not anie ſuch thing plainely ſet downe in the word of God, it was needefull that it ſhould haue beene ſignified to them, if any ſuch thing had bin thought neceſſary. But <hi>Bellarm.</hi> thus prooueth his argument: God hath not aboliſhed al things in his law, as he hath not taken away the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: therefore he hath not aboliſhed the ceremoniall law.</p>

But he telleth vs the ſacraments are not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, they are but changed: ſo the ſacrifices muſt be but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not taken away. When hee ſheweth what commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee hath to tell God what he muſt doe, we will regard his wordes, but vntill that bee ſhewed, hee muſt giue vs leaue, to acknowledge all theſe things in Chriſt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, eſpecially ſeeing the worde telleth vs not of anie commaundement to change it, or when, how, or into what it ſhould be changed. But I am loath to confute his groſſe aſſertions, and reaſonleſſe reaſons, whereby he ſeeketh to keepe vs ſtill in bondage to externall things. One or two arguments mo he hath, the one grounded vpon ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as themſelues haue deuiſed, betweene a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a ſacrifice, the other is the generall conſent of the church throughout the world: the firſt is ſomewhat touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fifteenth chapter, the other is the thing that is in queſtion, whether the true church haue acknowledged it to be a ſacrifice, truely ſo called, and properly.</p>
                     <p>Now to conclude, ſeeing in the inſtitution of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is not any ſacrifice preſcribed as the wordes do teach vs, neither can it be proued by the ſcriptures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we find any ſuch doctrine vniuerſally receiued of the fathers in the purer age of the church: Laſtly, ſeeing the arguments that are brought for defence of it, are ſo hard and obſcure, ſo forced and wreſted, as they are both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcriptures &amp; the fathers: let vs reſt vpon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,<note place="margin"> Heb. 9.28.

It is therefore a wonder to ſee how boldly and
<pb facs="tcp:13152:63"/> confidently out of this Text they will auouch, that out of theſe wordes are plainly prooued the actes of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,<note place="margin"> Bellar. de poenitent. lib. 1. ca. 10.</note> that is Confeſſion, and Satiſfaction, which muſt needs be in him that is looſed to be from his ſins. Is this to preach forgiueneſſe in the name of Chriſt? Secondly, I finde not in the primitiue church any ſuch doctrine of that their ſacrament of penance, as nowe is taught. Indeede they required Confeſſion, but eſpecially to God, as throughout the auncient fathers wee may ſee, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Tertullian</hi> his booke of repentance, which is by the Papiſts violently drawne in to bee a witneſſe for them, but can ſay nothing that will doe them good in this cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And although the fathers doe alſo ſometime allowe of Confeſſion to man, and that priuately: yet did they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer teach ſuch neceſſitie therof, as that without it ſinnes might not bee forgiuen, or that the mortall ſinnes (for thoſe onely muſt bee reckoned in Chriſt) cannot bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, vnleſſe the Prieſt haue them declared vnto him. Marke the writings of the Fathers, howe farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like they are to the bookes of our Popiſh Cleargie, and Romiſh writers in our dayes. <hi>Tertullian, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Auguſtine,</hi> and others, haue made whole bookes of this title <hi>De paenitentia, <hi>of penance,</hi>
                        </hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo hath made of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eleuen Homilies: yet out of theſe auncient fathers this Popiſh doctrine of the ſacrament of Penance cannot bee prooued, but that the teachers thereof, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced here and there to get ſome peeces of ſentences to make ſome ſhewe of proofe. And this verie ſhadowe of proofe is good enough to deceiue the ignoraunt and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in darkeneſſe, as the likeneſſe of men made of ſtone or other ſtuffe, ſet vpon the toppes of caſtels and holdes, make the enemie in the night afraide, for they think they are all men in deed, which in the day when they may bee viewed, doe eaſily ſhew what they are, namely ſtockes or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13152:63"/> ſtones. If <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> had knowen any ſuch Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might not he, writing two bookes of that matter, I meane of repentance, eſpecially againſt the Nouatians who denied vnto ſuch as offended after baptiſme, any hope of pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although they repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, might not he (I ſay) haue had from that ſacrament of the church, if the church had then knowen any ſuch ſacrament, a ſtrong and vnanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument againſt Nouatus or his followers, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying a Sacrament of the church? yes verily. But he vſed no ſuch argument, becauſe there was not then any ſuch Sacrament. Nay, the matter was not agreed vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreth yeares after <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> his time. For, as it appeareth by <hi>Gratian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> de poen. diſt. 1. c. quamuis.</note> who liued about the yeare one thouſand one hundred and fiftie, the matter was not then agreed vpon, but there were many and diuerſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whether confeſſion and ſatisfaction were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for this Sacrament, ſome affirming, others denying it, and <hi>Gratian</hi> ſaith that on both opinions there were <hi>wiſe and godly men,</hi> and therefore hee leaueth it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

We grant it, and for that cauſe hee hath appointed the miniſtery of the goſpell: but the promiſes are generall, and whether they publikely, or priuately, are to be vſed to the comforte of the afflicted, we finde not in the ſcripture any ſet forme ſet downe for abſolution: and therefore in the ſcriptures they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer find that outward ſigne which is required in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And therefore it ſeemeth that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dareth to defend that which the councell of Trent hath taught, concerning the forme of this their ſacrament. For
<pb facs="tcp:13152:65"/> the councell of Trent ſaith,<note place="margin"> Li. 1. de poen. cap. 16.</note> that theſe wordes are the forme of their Sacrament of penance. But maſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſaith, we are not tied to thoſe wordes, but that theſe words, <hi>I remit thee thy ſinnes,</hi> will alſo ſerue the turne. For this matter let them agree amongſt themſelues. But they muſt ſhew vs ſome outwarde ſigne appointed by Chriſt for this Sacrament, or els we muſt denie it to be a Sacrament. And that they haue laboured to doe theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, and yet they cannot doe it. But M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſtriueth earneſtly to proue that place, <hi>whoſe ſinnes ſo euer you remit, they are remitted,</hi> not to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of baptiſme. We will eaſe him of ſome labour, we will graunt that it is not ſpoken only of that remiſsion, that therein is done. Man is like a ruinous houſe, that muſt alwaies be repaired by repentance.<note place="margin"> Hom. 3. de paenitentia.</note> We haue alwaies need to pray, forgiue vs our treſpaſſes. Chriſoſtome pretily compareth ſinne in man, to an oake tree, which he that will cut it downe, muſt ſtrike not once, or twiſe only, but often, yea he muſt neuer leaue vntill it fall. So muſt we flie alwaies to this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not only once, or twiſe, but ten thouſands of times, if ſo often we offend, yea alwaies. The comfort of this promiſe therefore, we will in no wiſe reſtraine to the time of our baptiſme only: but we confeſſe that that forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, which in our baptiſme is ſealed vp vnto vs, hath force and vertue, through our whole life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are we aſſured, that this promiſe of the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, and remitting of the ſame is moſt certaine and true, and belongeth to our whole life, and to euery ſinne that we commit.</p>
                     <p>Now this forgiuenes ſay (the papiſts) muſt be applied vnto vs by the ſacrament of penaunce. They ſhould proue that: for in matters of religion their credite is not ſo good that we dare truſt them. And the leſſe wee truſt them in this matter, becauſe we are ſure that God hath giuen vnto vs other meanes to apply his mercy vnto vs, namely his word: for applying whereof vnto our conſciences, hee hath
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13152:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> appointed his miniſtery in his church. Yea, he hath giuen his word to be read and knowne of euery bodie. Then alſo hath he giuen vs Sacraments, to confirme vs in this word, and to make vs more confidently to beleeue it, and more faithfully to receiue it. Theſe therefore are the meanes whereby our faith is nouriſhed, and made more bolde and ſtrong, to apply to our humbled hartes thoſe comfortable promiſes of Gods good graces, which in the words are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and by baptiſme, and the ſupper of the Lord are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp in our conſciences. Nowe, other Sacramentes we know not, and namelie this of penance. Neither is there any neceſſarie conſequence in this argument: Theſe wordes are ſpoken of remiſsion of ſinnes, after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: therefore there muſt needes bee a Sacrament of penance. And that ſhould bee proued. And therefore to grant him that, which hee ſo ſtriueth for, will doe him no good. After this one place that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath out of the Scriptures, he commeth to the fathers,<note place="margin"> De paenit. li. 1. cap. 10.</note> who becauſe they afforde him no plaine proofe, he indeuoureth to wring ſomething from them by indirect meanes. The proofe therefore that he hath from them, as himſelfe profeſſeth, is either becauſe that when they reckon vp the true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, they often make mention of repentance alſo, or els they compare it with the ſacrament of baptiſme, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is God that worketh in them both. Had it not bin better to yeeld vnto the truth, then thus before hee proueth any thing out of the fathers to proclaime the weakenes of his proofe? For is not this a weake argument: The fathers in reckoning vp the ſacraments do often alſo make mention of penance: therfore it is a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Or this: bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme &amp; repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are many times co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared togither, but the one is a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t properly ſo called: therfore alſo the other muſt ſo be? I truſt the weaknes of that argument is eaſie to ſpie out, ſeeing the fathers may in diuers reſpects ſpeak of the ſacraments, other than of their ſacramentall nature, or of thoſe things which they ſeeme to match with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb facs="tcp:13152:66"/> in ſpeech, not minding to make any mo ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than Chriſt left vnto the church: therefore ſo long as his arguments are but coniectures, euen by his owne confeſſion, it is but loſt labour to beſtow any more time thereupon. Therefore, although we confeſſe that our whole life ſhould be a continuall profiting in the doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and the practiſe thereof, yet the ſacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we iuſtly reiect, becauſe neither the ſcripture nor moſt ancient fathers, yeeld any plaine teſtimony thereof.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13152:67"/> this ſacrament. Wherby we learn that themſelues are not well reſolued as yet, what ſhall bee the externall ſigne in this ſacrament. For in deed that which Chriſt did when hee ordained miniſters, that externall ſigne (I ſay) they make ſmall account of: for he <hi>Breathing on them ſaid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Iohn 20. Tract. in Iohn. 121</note> 
                        <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue ye the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Whereby Chriſt would teach (as ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinketh) that the holy Ghoſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the father and the ſonne alſo. And no maruell if they vrge not that ceremonie: for Chriſt himſelfe is not verie curious in that point.<note place="margin"> Mat. 28.19 Mar. 16.15 Mar. 10.6, 7</note> And as himſelfe did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that ceremonie to bee vſed: ſo neither did himſelfe practiſe it any more but that once, as may appeare in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places, where hee authoriſeth his Apoſtles to preach without breathing vpon them. And nowe, for laying on of handes, which many times the Apoſtles vſed, wee haue not only the teſtimonie of manie in the popiſh church, that thinke it not to be the principall outward ſigne in this ſacrament, but thinke the giuing of a chalice with wine, and the couer of it with bread, to be more eſſentiall and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall: but alſo we ſee that there is no commaundement giuen to the Apoſtles for it, and therefore neither doe they commaund it to be vſed, as a thing ſo neceſſarie that it may not be omitted. And whereas we acknowledge this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to haue ſundrie vſes: firſt in reſpect of the church, the partie ordained is by that ceremonie notified vnto the church: ſecondly, he is confirmed thereby in his calling, put in minde of his dutie, and aſſured of his vocation by this common approbation, that hereby the church ſheweth. Thirdly, thereby the church doeth teſtifie, as it were before God, their ſincere dealing in their election, and conſecrate him to the ſeruice of God. Laſtly, the Godly vſed manie times in praying for others, to lay their hands vpon them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the place aboue named beſtoweth ſome paines, to proue, that praier and laying on of hands are two diſtinct things, which is not denied. To be ſhort, the ſumme of his argument is this: it was vſed of the Apoſtles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:13152:68"/> it is ſo neceſſarie that it cannot be omitted. We anſwer that that ceremonie had good vſes, but yet might be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Becauſe our ſauiour Chriſt did neither vſe it nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it. And to thinke that he omitted anie ſubſtantial point of religion, or that the Apoſtles would account as ſimply neceſſary any thing not vſed or preſcribed by Chriſt, is to abſurd. And whereas they proue the promiſe of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace to be made by Chriſt, vnto them that receyue this their ſacrament of Orders, I wonder that they ſee not, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both many are iuſtified that neuer entered into their Orders, &amp; many alſo that haue had, and haue their greaſing and ſcraping, are as wicked men, and ſo by likelihood as far from this iuſtifying grace as Turkes or Iewes. And ſo it eaſily appeareth, that this ſecond thing required in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, namely that it ſhould ſeale in vs the promiſe of iuſtification, hath not ſo much as anie likelihoode, to bee in this their ſacrament of Orders. The third thing neceſſarie in a ſacrament is Gods commaundement, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they confeſſe their want, and that they haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. But yet becauſe God did giue grace with laying on of the Apoſtles handes,<note place="margin"> 1 Tim. 4. Bellar. de ord. ſacra. li. 1. ca. 2.</note> therefore they take it as commaunded of God. If this bee a good argumente God gaue g od ſucceſſe to it: therefore it is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, many ſtrange partes in <hi>Sampſon, Iehu,</hi> and others, will prooue to be commaunded of God: but that is moſt falſe, as the Papiſts themſelues will confeſſe. God did not onely proſper <hi>Phinehas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Numb. 25</note> in that which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt <hi>Zimrie,</hi> and <hi>Cosby,</hi> but commended the fact alſo, and graciouſly rewarded the ſame, but yet he had no commaundement for ſo doing. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God may bee ſaide in ſome ſort to like of that to which he giueth good ſucceſſe, yet no man can thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God hath commaunded it: But rather on the contrary, we may thus reaſon. The laying on of hands was neither practiſed by our ſauiour Chriſt, neither commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him or his Apoſtles: therefore that ceremonie is not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13152:68"/> of ſuch neceſſitie, but that ordination may bee without it. Yea but Chriſt is not tyed to the ſacrament (ſayth maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) and therefore can giue the effect of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament without the ſacrament,<note place="margin"> Cap. 2. li. 1.</note> hee can make Prieſtes without laying on of handes. That hee can ſo doe, wee confeſſe, but that hee dealeth ſo in the inſtitution of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, all the Papiſts in the worlde will neuer bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proue: for in them we ſee that all things are moſt plaine, the outward ſigne, the promiſe, the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing in them hidden, nothing doubtfull. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe himſelfe dare not well reſt vpon that anſwere, hee concludeth that ſeconde chapter with another aunſwere, for hee telleth vs, that it may bee that Chriſt did lay his hands vpon them whom he made miniſters. Is this good dealing? Doeth not this manifeſtly bewray the weakeneſſe of their cauſe, when ſuch friuolous coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the chiefe ſtrength of their cauſe? As for the Fathers whatſoeuer out of them they doe alledge, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prooue that which they take in hande: namely, that the ſacrament of Orders is a ſacrament like to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> For all men muſt confeſſe, that theſe two ſacraments, which wee acknowledge to be common to all Chriſtians, are farre vnlike in that point to that popiſh ſacrament, which belongeth but vnto a fewe.</p>
                     <p>And euen in this conſiſteth eſpecially the true vſe of Baptiſme, and of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that they ſhould be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall teſtifications vnto the whole church of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſeales of his promiſes, and pledges of his loue and fauour, And therefore the fathers ſometime call Ordination a ſacrament, yet it followeth not, that they take it to bee a ſacrament in the proper ſenſe, but in that ſenſe onely as they call manie other things Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which the Popiſh Church doeth not receyue as Sacraments.<note place="margin"> De Sacrat. ord. li: 1. ca <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> But (ſay they) the Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Ordination with Baptiſme. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh
<pb facs="tcp:13152:69"/> great reckoning of that argument. The fathers may be ſo in ſome reſpect, becauſe the ſacrament of Baptiſme can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reiterated: no more muſt he that is once ordained to the miniſterie, ſeeke to be ordayned againe for euerie action that he performeth in his miniſterie, but hee is once for all appointed thereto. But what is that to the nature of the ſacrament, which muſt by a viſible ſigne aſſure vs of inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible graces. So that, athough Ordination be like to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, after a ſort, yet is it not like to Baptiſme, in that it by a viſible ſigne doeth aſſure vs of inuiſible graces: but onely, becauſe it is not to bee reiterated no more than Baptiſme is. And thus wee ſee the weakeneſſe of this argument: Ordination is in ſome poynt like to Baptiſme: therefore it is a ſacrament in ſuch ſort as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is. Thus then, I truſt it appeareth howe weakely they proue Ordination to be a ſacrament, who haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcriptures,<note place="margin"> Matt. 28.19</note> nor fathers for the ſame. But if they could prooue that Ordination which Chriſt vſed to bee a ſacrament, what is that to Popiſh Ordination? Chriſt ſent the Apoſtles to preach, <hi>Goe teach all nations:</hi> but by their ordination the popiſh prieſts <hi>Receiue power to offer a ſacrifice.</hi> The Apoſtles executed their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which Chriſt gaue them, as appeareth in the Acts and their Epiſtles. And the popiſh prieſts on the other ſide thinke there is no ſeruice any thing ſo pleaſing to God, as the offering of ſacrifices. We ſee then, that as Ordination, euen as Chriſt and his Apoſtles vſed it, is not a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly ſo called: ſo popiſh Ordination is nothing but a meere prophanation of Chriſts order, and a wilfull breach of his commaundement, and therefore moſt vnworthie of the name of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>That matrimony is not a ſacrament, ſpeaking of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament properly, as when wee call baptiſme or the ſupper of the Lord ſacraments, it is moſt plaine: Firſt, becauſe the things that are required in a ſacrament, are not to bee found in it, namely, an outward ſigne, a promiſe of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace, Gods inſtitution or commandement. As for the commaundement, ſome woulde wring it out of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:13152:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> wordes,<note place="margin"> Matth. 19.6.</note> 
                        <hi>That which God hath ioyned together, let no man put aſunder.</hi> But that is onely a prohibition, that man ſhal not looſe that knot which God hath knit, there is no ſacrament commaunded. And maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpying that fault, dareth not commend their indeuor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but taketh another courſe. For he thinketh his friends troubled themſelues more than they needed, to be too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in ſearching where it is commanded to be made a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But if Gods commandement, or the inſtitution of the ſacrament be neceſſarily required in a ſacrament (as Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath often ſhewed) the Papiſts (by his leaue) ſhall either ſhew,<note place="margin"> De ſacram. matrimon. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> when, and how, it was inſtituted to be a ſacrament, or elſe there is no cauſe that we ſhould truſt them, although they al had ſworne, that it is one. For in truth this their doctrine is ſo doubtful &amp; vncertaine, that themſelues know not what to ſay of it. For, ſome thinke that it hath alwayes bin a ſacrament, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde:<note place="margin"> De ſacram. matrimon. lib. 1. cap. 5 Seſſ. 24. can. 2.</note> but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wil not in any wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to that. And the councel of Trent is flat of that mind, that it is a ſacrament inſtituted by Chriſt, and therfore not of the old law. If then it be true, that matrimony was not a ſacrament vntil Chriſt made it one, it is needful that they ſhould prooue, that Chriſt hath made it a ſacrament, before we can receiue it for one. And this reaſon is very ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who reaſoneth againſt them that think that matrimony was a ſacrament of the old law, becauſe, <hi>It is not read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there was any inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of marriage in al the olde teſtament:</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Ioh. 5.32.</note> he meaneth after mans fall. Therefore, if they prooue no inſtitution of it, they prooue no Sacrament. Nowe for the ſecond point. For to prooue it to be an outward ſigne they bring thoſe wordes of Saint <hi>Paule, This is a great ſacrament</hi> (for ſo the old tranſlation hath) but the word ſignifieth alſo a myſterie or ſecret. But wee will not contend of the worde. Will they imagine that this word can prooue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony to be a ſacrament? Wee ſee that Chriſt and his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13152:70"/> Apoſtles are more carefull of the true vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, than of their names, as may appeare by thoſe two Sacramentes which we acknowledge, which are not ſo much as named ſacramentes. Secondly, to proue it to be a ſacrament, it is not enough to ſhew that it is a ſigne of a holy thing, but that it was inſtituted to bee ſuch a ſigne. And that can they neuer doe in this.<note place="margin"> Sacr. mat. li. 1. cap. 5.</note> For it was inſtituted in paradiſe, where it was no ſuch ſigne as themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, as is ſhewed, yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denieth that there is in matrimony any outward ſigne by the inſtitution of it. So that although it repreſent vnto vs (to our vnſpeakeable comfort) the vnion and coniunction, betweene Chriſt and his church, yet that it was not inſtituted to that end, &amp; that it is not an outward ſigne by the inſtitution of it, it is moſt plaine. But how will they proue the third thing, namely the promiſe of ſaluation to be in this their ſacrament? For ſooth becauſe it repreſenteth vnto vs the ſpirituall loue of Chriſt to his church, &amp; hir obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to him againe. That is alſo performed in euery body of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if we marke the vnion betweene the members and the head. In euery vine tree, yea in euery plant, if wee conſider the coherence betweene the branches and the tree. Yea many ſuch things there are that haue as much in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belonging to a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as matrimony hath. And yet howſoeuer they may be vnto vs, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we may do, I neuer heard or read that euer they were acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in the proper ſence. And why? becauſe God neuer appointed them to that end. for in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Chriſts inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the eſpecial thing, how little account ſo euer M. <hi>Bellar.</hi> make of it. The 2. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument whereby I proue matrimony not to be a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, bicauſe that many of the ſcholemen, who are the eſpecial friends to thoſe popiſh ſacraments, doubt whether matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie giueth grace, which the popiſh church doth attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to all ſacraments. For as <hi>Canus</hi> reporteth:<note place="margin"> De locis Theol. li. 8. cap. 5.</note> the Ma. of ſentences, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine, Scot, Bonauenture, Rich. de S. victore, Paludanus, Durand</hi> &amp; others do not define,
<pb facs="tcp:13152:71"/> whether it giue grace or not, but leaue it to euery mans owne opinion. As for the matter or forme of this ſacrament (to vſe <hi>Canus</hi> his words) theſe ſchoolemen do ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo vnconſtant and wauering, ſo vncertaine and doubtfull, that he ſhoulde but prooue himſelfe a foole, that in ſuch difference and diſagreement, would ſet downe any thing for certaine or true. And for that cauſe the Councell of Florence (ſaith he) decreed nothing of the matter, forme, or miniſter of this ſacrament, becauſe it ſaw, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines in the ſchooles had concluded nothing of them. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therfore themſelues within ſo few yeares doubted, yea and are not yet fully reſolued, whether that ſacrament giue grace, without the which it cannot bee a ſacrament in the Popiſh church: they giue vs iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect, nay flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affirme, that it was not a ſacrament inſtituted by Chriſt. For if it had, before this time doubtleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at the leaſt woulde haue reſolued of ſuch principall points thereof. And if Chriſt did not inſtitute it a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then alſo we may deny it at all to bee a ſacrament: For neither men nor angels may inſtitute any ſacraments (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath truely noted.<note place="margin"> De ſacram. Matrim. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> Neither are they yet agreed, whether euery marriage is this their ſacrament. For <hi>Canus</hi> in the place before alleaged, thinketh not any matrimony to be this ſacrament, but that onely that is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized by the Prieſt. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with all the ſkill he hath oppoſeth himſelfe againſt him,<note place="margin"> De ſacram. Matrim. lib. 1. cap. 7</note> yea, it is high time he ſhould ſo do. For hee plainely confeſſeth, that if that opinion of <hi>Canus</hi> be true, then they ſhall neuer out of the ſcriptures or councels bee able to prooue the ſacrament of matrimony.</p>
                     <p>Then wee ſee it ſtandeth him vpon to doe what he can: For, either muſt the marriages not ſolemnized by the Prieſts, bee this ſacrament (and ſo euery man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is a miniſter in this ſacrament) which his own friends will in no wiſe graunt vnto him: or elſe matrimony is not a ſacrament. And then they haue deceiued the world ſome
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13152:71"/> hundreds of yeeres. Thirdly, matrimony can not be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe the promiſe of grace is common vnto all ſorts of men and women. And therfore the ſacraments and ſignes alſo of thoſe graces ſhoulde belong vnto all ſortes. But in the Popiſh church matrimony is denied to ſome ſortes, as to their cleargie: Therefore, by their owne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it can not be a Sacrament, eſpecially ſuch a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as baptiſme and the euchariſt, for they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all ſortes:<note place="margin"> Marriage lawfull for all men.</note> but matrimony (they ſay) muſt not ſo be. And this is the ſecond point of their doctrine which muſt be examined. For it ſeemeth to mee very ſtrange, that they, who haue nowe ſo magnified this eſtate of life, that it muſt be no leſſe than a holy ſacrament, doe ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely debaſe the ſame, that they thinke it not pure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their ſhorne and annointed creatures. But I looke that they ſhould come againſt mee with an anſwere out of maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> De ſacram. matrim. ca. 5</note> that their Prieſtes in deede are forbidden to marry, but not in that reſpect that it is a ſacrament, but becauſe of thoſe things that followe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and are impediments and lets to them in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And yet neither all the conſequents of marriage are denied to their clergie: For maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth vs there, that if a man and wife being married together will promiſe continencie, they may well enough take their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and are truely both married folkes and prieſts. So that not cares or troubles that are incident vnto married folkes oftentimes, are any thing to bee reſpected in this caſe: For cleargy men may haue all theſe, but the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all duety of marriage they may not perfourme. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Papiſts to defend the credit of this their ſacrament, doe robbe the Cleargie of that thing which is the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all repreſentation of the coniunction of Chriſt and of his church, whileſt they would make theſe beleeue, that the performaunce of the duety betweene man and wife, is a thing not to be ſuffered in Cleargie men.</p>
                     <p>The very ground of this aſſertion of maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13152:72"/> is that hee thinketh not the copulation of married folke to bee of the ſubſtaunce of Matrimonie. And this he prooueth by ſome teſtimonies out of the fathers in that fift Chapter. But yet himſelfe will not, that this his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould bee ſo vnderſtoode, as if that hee ſayd, that the vſe of marriage is not any way of the ſubſtaunce of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.<note place="margin"> Chap. 6</note> For afterwardes hee ſayeth, that this their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may haue two reſpects. As it is made, and as it is continued. As it made, that is, (if I be not deceyued) as the mutuall conſent of parties ioyneth them together by their promiſes, the conſent expreſſed by ſuch wordes, is the matter and forme of their ſacrament. And thus muſt wee vnderſtand that common rule in their lawe, that conſent maketh marriages. And thus doe the fathers vnderſtand that which they ſay concerning the ſubſtaunce of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to conſiſt in the mutuall conſent: partly, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch conſent giuen, the parties are not free to chaunge the choyſe which they haue made:<note place="margin"> Deu. 22, 23 24</note> And partly becauſe that euen by Gods lawe, if parties after ſuch conſent giuen, ſhoulde carnally knowe another, it was death for them ſo to doe: which could not bee, but becauſe this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is after a ſort the marriage it ſelfe. This, if it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any thing to vs, doeth but repreſent that ioyning of Chriſt with vs by ſpirituall loue,<note place="margin"> Chap. 5</note> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth. But that is not any ſpeciall benefite, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: For hee loueth all his creatures, and wept for the deſtruction of his enemies: And one man may be ſo ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with another. But it is a ſpeciall grace, that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age repreſenteth vnto vs: to vs (I ſay) that after a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner belong to him. Namely, howe wee are made fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, howe our bodies are the members of Chriſts bodie, howe in deed hee is, as in name hee is called, God with vs. This is repreſented vnto vs, but by that copulation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and wife, whereby, as before by conſent they were of one minde, ſo nowe by it they are one bodie. For
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13152:72"/> by copulation the wife is made one bodie with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. And this doe I take to bee confeſſed by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, when hee telleth vs that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde reſpect by Matrimonie, is meant that which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth. And then muſt the bodyes of them that are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed needes be the matter of this ſacrament, euen their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation and dwelling togither. And therefore he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well of the iudgement of <hi>Peter Soto,</hi> that thinketh euen this vſe of Matrimonie to bee the matter, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about which this Sacrament is occupyed, but of which it is made or conſiſteth. If then it bee the matter of their Sacrament, which they denie to their Cleargie, it is not true that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaide, that they denie not their Cleargie men to marrie, as marriage is a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For they deny that to them which is the ſubſtance of their ſacrament.</p>
                     <p>This may alſo appeare by the definition of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which we may finde in the fathers.<note place="margin"> Strom. 2. li. De Monog.</note> Marriage (ſayeth <hi>Clemens</hi> of Alexandria) is the firſt lawfull ioyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of man and woman, for the procreation of children. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> is inquiſitiue what is marriage before God, and findeth it to bee when God ioyneth together two into one fleſh. Then if we wil ſpeake properly of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, it is the ioyning together, not of minds, or heartes onely, but of bodies alſo. Yea,<note place="margin"> li. 1. chap. 5 De Sacram. matrim.</note> and it is confeſſed by mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that ſuch marriages as haue not copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are but a maimed and vnperfect Sacrament, and that Prieſtes may ſo be married. And howe his fellowes will take this at his handes, I cannot tell: that they who count themſelues moſt perfect, ſhould not bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to that vnperfect Sacrament, whereas the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, and knowne ſinners, might bee partakers of the perfect Sacrament. But let them order thoſe matters amongeſt themſelues. But ſaint <hi>Baſil</hi> perchance would admit them to the vſe of marriage, ſince maiſter <hi>Bellar.</hi> doth permit them to marry,<note place="margin"> De vera Virginitate.</note> ſo that they abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13152:73"/> the vſe of it. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſince the reaſon of the minde directing, hath manifeſtly ioined their hearts in reſpect of ſome neceſsitie, worthily doth the vnitie of bodies, to which they are knit, folow thoſe hearts ſo vnited:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this lerned father ſeemeth to me to be of that mind, that there is no cauſe, but that whoſoeuer may in heart be ioined vnto another as to his wife, may alſo in bodie bee ioyned with her. And ſo if it be lawfull for them to marry, and to continue married,<note place="margin"> Cap. 5.</note> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, it is alſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to haue the vſe of marriage, as ſaint <hi>Baſill</hi> here ſaieth. But what is the reaſon why they ſtande ſo much in this matter? Are they not men? haue they not infirmities? Can they who this day finde themſelues to be voyde of ſuch aſſaults, as are the fruites of wanton luſts, promiſe to themſelues that they ſhall bee ſo to morrowe likewiſe, and ſo to continue alſo? Let no man deceyue himſelfe in that fooliſh imagination: no body can aſſure themſelues of anie ſuch thing, it is a rare gift of God. <hi>All men cannot receiue this thing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Mat. 19.11 1. Cor. 7, 7 17 De monac. li. 2. cap. 31</note> 
                        <hi>but they to whome it is giuen.</hi> If it be a gift of God, as <hi>Bellar.</hi> confeſſeth, it is too much preſumption for vs to be ſo bold to promiſe it, as though it were within our owne reach. If it bee care, it is too much wickedneſſe, and too great occaſion of offence, for the church of Rome to require it, ſo as they doe of all their cleargie. Yea, but they teach this as a doctrine that needes muſt bee beleeued,<note place="margin"> De Cler. li. 1 cap. 21</note> and with a full conſent, and namely <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> That they haue the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie that will. And againe, That there is no man that cannot liue continently, if himſelfe will. Of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of free will. I ſhall God willing ſpeake more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereafter. But now for this bolde and groſſe affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am verily perſwaded, that it neuer could haue come from any man, vnleſſe either his minde were blinded with ignorance, that hee ſaw not the trueth of his owne eſtate, or his heart were either poſſeſſed with ſuch a ſenſeleſneſſe that it could feele no ſinne, or elſe ſo bent to reſiſt the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13152:73"/> truth, that he would not yeeld to it, although hee knewe it. For what can bee found in the ſcriptures more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, than the falles of the godly, the faults of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, their complaints, their ſighes, yea, their teares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſinnes?

But to aſke, that we ſhould not ſtand in need of that helpe and remedie agaynſt ſinne, that God hath prouided, or that wee ſhould liue a more angellicall life, than hee hath appoynted vs to doe, is to tempt God in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king without our warrant, and therefore without fayth, and to deſpiſe that meaſure of grace that God hath vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedſafe to beſtowe vpon vs. The treaſure is great that wee who are Gods miniſters doe carrie, although in earthen veſſels, that the power might bee of God,<note place="margin"> 2.

For whereas hee ſayeth of all, of all (I ſay) and not of laie men onely, <hi>It is better to marrie than to burne,</hi> this doting doctour <hi>Smith</hi> ſayth, and ſo do his fellowes: it is better for a prieſt, not to burne onely, but euen to commit whoredome, than to marrie.

His anſwer is, that yet whilſt they are free, and haue made no vow, if they ſee they cannot continue, <hi>Ciprian</hi> faith, it is beſt for them to marry. But that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath as far miſſed the cuſhion, as others before him haue done: and that his anſwere is moſt vntrue, I proue, firſt by the queſtion which was moued vnto <hi>Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> For <hi>Pomponius</hi> to whom he writeth, did aſke of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> what hee ſhould thinke of ſome women, who had profeſſed virginity, and yet were founde in bed with men. So that if he anſwere directly to <hi>Pomponius</hi> his queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſheweth what ſhould be done, with ſuch as had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vowed, and not of ſuch as were to make the vow. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the very words next before, it doth moſt plainelie appeare, that he maketh two ſorts of ſuch as haue made the vow, the one ſort he would haue to continue, namely ſuch as through faith haue yeelded themſelues to Chriſt: the other of them that will not, or cannot. Thirdly, that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that to excuſe themſelues they would offer to bee tried by women, whether they were virgins, (for vnto that their excuſe <hi>Ciprian</hi> maketh anſwere) is ſo ſtrong an argument, as maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all his friends, will neuer be able to anſwere, to proue that thoſe words of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> are not ment, neither can be vnderſtood, of ſuch as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13152:75"/> ſtood in doubt, whether they would vow or not, as maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth, but of ſuch as after their vow, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would, nor could perſeuere in their purpoſe. For if that only had beene their doubt, whether they could conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue virgins, that matter the women could not iudge of. If whether they were virgins, it is directly againſt maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> anſwere to this place. It is not therefore to giue occaſion of wantonnes, to teach mariage to be lawfull for all men, as without ſhame they affirme, as by the holie Apoſtle and that learned father appeareth, but they that condemne it, doe let looſe the raines vnto all vncleanenes, as ſaith <hi>Saint Bernard,</hi>

And he is their very oracle, who, if he hold his peace, they know not what to thinke of the matter. But <hi>Iohn Maior, Clichtouaeus</hi> and ſome others, doe affirme that this ſingle life is commanded by God himſelfe.

                        <note place="margin"> De cler. li. 1. cap. 19. Tit. 1.8.</note> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though continent and chaſte is in truth all one thing, yet maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wil not thinke it ſufficient that a biſhop
<pb facs="tcp:13152:76"/> ſhould be chaſte becauſe he knoweth that <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> and other of the fathers affirme that there is chaſtity in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but he will doubtles ſpie ſome greater vertue in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency then in chaſtity, and therefore he will haue a biſhop not chaſt only, but alſo continent. But if we muſt ſeeke for a difference betweene theſe two wordes, I take this to be it, that continencie is of ſhorter continuance, that is to ſay, but an abſtinence for a time, and chaſtitie is a vertue that indureth. And the examples brought by maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himſelfe approue this difference. But <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi> doe take continencie to be an abſtinence not from luſts only, but from al vice, ſo that as <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi> ſaith, he muſt rule his tongue, his handes, and his eies. <hi>Hierom</hi> vpon theſe wordes ſaith plainelie, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle neuer ſpeaketh of continencie or incontinencie, but in reſpect of wanton luſtes, but yet he taketh continencie, to be ſuch a vertue, as may be in maried folke. And therefore the Apoſtle (ſaith he) hauing ſpoken of a biſhop, that hee may haue one wife, leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to permit incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, to them addeth this: and with <hi>Hierom</hi> agreeth <hi>Primaſius.</hi> So that they make continent, and chaſte, all one.<note place="margin"> 1.

But if we marke the fiftieth Canon of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles wherein there is a prouiſo, that none ſhoulde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from mariage becauſe hee thinketh it to bee euill, it will eaſilie appeare, that the ſixt Canon was made, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart the fooliſh opinion of them, that condemned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as a thing more vncleane, then that it ſhould be fit for prieſtes or biſhops. And thus much to proue, that mariage of prieſtes is not euill of it ſelfe, or vnlawfull in reſpect of any commandement in Gods word. Now that it is alſo lawfull, I am perſwaded by theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe of the vncertainety of the contrarie doctrine: for ſome ſay, that ſole life is commanded by God, others denie it as you haue heard. Againe there are, and thoſe papiſts too, that ſay the lawe of abſtaining from mariage,<note place="margin"> Fab. Tract. 4. in Luth. de mat. clear.</note> for the clergie was firſt made by pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> who liued almoſt four hundred yeares after Chriſt, although <hi>Iohn Faber</hi> report that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus</hi> forbad it ſomewhat before. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thinke in no wiſe that it may be ſuffered, that this their doctrine ſhoulde bee thought ſo farre ſhorte of the times of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>Some holde it a neceſſarie lawe,<note place="margin"> Bellarm. li. 1. de clericis, cap. 18.</note> others but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. And ſuch diuerſitie of doctrine in theſe and ſuch like pointes is, if not an inuincible, yet a verie proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofe that their doctrine hath no ſure grounde in Gods word, no great conſent of antiquitie, and that is the
<pb facs="tcp:13152:77"/> cauſe that there is no certaine doctrine of it amongeſt themſelues, and ſuch is their agreement alſo concerning that other point, whether matrimony be a ſacrament or not. Secondly, the weakenes of their proofe, doth euen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime vnto the world, the weakenes of their cauſe. For the moſt and beſt learned of them doe confeſſe that God hath not commanded it. And the proofes that they bring out of the Apoſtle for it, as it ſeemeth, haue ſo little waight in them, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is aſhamed to alleadge them.

                        <hi>That a biſhop ſhould be continent,</hi> how little it can helpe his cauſe, you haue heard before. Seeing therfore that either they bring nothing worth hearing out of Gods word, or apply vnto the clergy only, that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to all men and weomen indifferently, (ſuch is all that they alleadge out of the 7. Chapter of <hi>S.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13152:77"/> their doctrines, as it is knowen they were, how much more may we reiect this their lawe, as hurtfull to Gods church, and iniurious to our wiſe Law-maker, and ſuſpect it not to reſt vpon good ground. Thirdly, the moſt blaſphemous commendation that they giue vnto this eſtate of life, and the efficacie and vertue, that impudently and vntruely they do aſcribe vnto the ſame, maketh me thinke it is but a bird of their owne clecking, and that therein they ſeeke rather their owne praiſe than Gods glory. Becauſe thereby they teach men to looke for remiſſion of ſinnes, and make it a thing meritorious: and ſo they robbe Chriſt of his honour, and take from him his office, to attribute the ſame to the obſeruation of their vngodly lawe. And vnto this reaſon which is taken from the euil fruit of their wicked doctrine, I might alſo adde the ſower grape of vngodly life that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſame. Which made not Papiſts onely, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Pope himſelfe to wiſh the aboliſhing of that cruel lawe, and the remoouing of that dangerous ſtumbling blocke, as before you haue heard of <hi>Pius,</hi> the ſecond pope of that name. Nowe beſides theſe wants that wee finde in the contrary doctrine which may induce vs to ſee the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelihoode of the ſame, wee haue alſo the firſt inſtitution wherein it was ſaide to all without exception,<note place="margin"> Geneſ. 1.28.</note> 
                        <hi>Increaſe and multiplie.</hi> Then alſo wee haue that generall aduiſe and counſell wherein the apoſtle aduiſeth all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that it is better to marry than to burne:<note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 7.9.</note> which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe the apoſtle giueth in reſpect of that common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wherein wee finde it to be true that euery man can not attaine to the gift of chaſtitie in ſingle life. Thirdly, wee haue alſo particular direction for biſhops by name, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting marriage vnto them,<note place="margin"> 1. Tim. 3.2 Tit. 1.6.</note> that no man can doubt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vnleſſe hee wilfully winke for feare he ſhoulde ſee the light of the trueth. Fourthly, we haue the practiſe of the prieſts in the olde lawe, who were married, although they had the daily ſacrifice to offer morning and euening. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the apoſtles, and many biſhops of the Primitiue
<pb facs="tcp:13152:78"/> church alſo, if they will truſt <hi>Vicelius</hi> their owne friend, were married men. Therefore we may conclude, that for the clergie, as for other it is lawfull, that euery man haue his owne wife, and euery woman her own huſband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it alſo followeth, that not only the Montaniſts, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches, Eucratians.

                        </gap> error, and doctrines of deuils, who haue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences burned with a hote iron, forbidding to marry. For although others may perchaunce in that point be worſe, yet that proueth not that they cannot be euill. And although the fathers doe expound this place, of thoſe heretickes that were before or in their time, yet is that no barre to vs, but that we may in like maner confute thereby all them, who doe in any ſort condemne matrimony. But they ſaie they condemne not matrimonie, neither force men to ſingle life. Whether they haue drawen men to their vowes or not,<note place="margin"> Bellarm. de cler. li. 1. cap. 20.</note> let the world iudge. But it is but a ſhift to ſaie, they denie not mariage. They deny it to that whole eſtate, in ſo much as in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, we haue ſeene the clergy forced, either to leaue their function and miniſtery, or to forſake their wiues. So that although they ſay not to any man or woman particularly, thou ſhalt in no wiſe marry, yet they deny it to that eſtate of life, which needs muſt be in the worlde, as not holy enough for them, wherein if they were well examined, they would be found to conſpire with thoſe auncient heretickes.</p>

                     <p> Other differences alſo might be found, but theſe few are ſufficient to ſhew, that the church of Rome hath added to the word of God, and practiſe of the Apoſtles in this point: and therefore, if that were graunted vnto them, which they can not prooue, namely, that that which the Apoſtles did, was a ſacrament: yet can it in no wiſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that the Popiſh anoyling can bee a Sacrament, vnto the which they haue added ſo many, yea, and ſome of them ſo vnſeemely ceremonies.

They haue not ſo much as any ſhew or colour that it was inſtituted by Chriſt, or before his death, but onely that place of ſaint <hi>Marke,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Mar. 6.13.</note> where it is ſaide, that the Apoſtles annointed many that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and healed them.

And he will not in any ſort haue thoſe wordes to bee the ground or inſtitution of the Sacrament. And for that cauſe hee prooueth by many reaſons, that they are not all one. For hee ſeeth that it can not be denied, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelfe graunteth, that that vnction which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

Therefore hee will in no wiſe like of them that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge this place of ſaint <hi>Marke</hi> for this their ſacrament, although they bee many, yea, and thoſe great pillers of Poperie, and no ſmall fooles I warrant you: But ſuch as <hi>Eckius,</hi>

                     <p>And as truly alſo if hee ſhould affirme, that it hath no warrant out of that place of ſaint <hi>Iames.</hi> For that place of ſaint <hi>Marke,</hi> and that other of ſaint <hi>Iames,</hi> ſpeake both of one ſort of annointing, as <hi>Beda, Theophilact.</hi> and <hi>Occumenius</hi> doe teſtifie.

And then is it deſtitute of all proofe by Gods worde, and ſo muſt bee accounted but a fooliſh toy (as nowe it is vſed) of mans braine. Neither are they agreed vpon that other high poynt, what parts muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted of neceſſitie, whether all thoſe ſeuen parts before mentioned, or els only thoſe fiue firſt, which are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſenſes.</p>

For hee at the poynt of death diſputed with a learned man the Biſhop of Ferrara earneſtly, whether hee might againe bee annoyled, ſeeing hee had once before beene annoyled. By all which diuerſities of iudgements in the moſt materiall pointes of this their Sacrament, they giue vs iuſt cauſe to doubt of their Sacrament it ſelfe, that it is not of God.

                     <p>And thus briefly we ſee, how the Papiſts differ from the ſcriptures, whereupon themſelues indeuor (but al in vaine)

Wherein I knowe not whether they haue ſomewhat wounded themſelues,<note place="margin"> Cap 1.</note> both becauſe they ſay themſelues but a little before, that it is inſinuated by Chriſt, which is leſſe than inſtituted. And alſo it is <hi>tanquam vere &amp; propriè Sacramentum, <hi>as it were</hi>
                        </hi> (which is a doubtfull ſpeach) <hi>truely and properly a Sacrament.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> De ſacram. Vnct. cap. 2.</note> But let vs ſee howe maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> prooueth this to bee a Sacrament out of that place of ſaint <hi>Iames.</hi> Hee can finde, as he ſuppoſeth, the outwarde ſigne.<note place="margin"> The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne</note> True it is there is an outwarde ſigne, but it is not that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in annoyling nowe: for nowe it muſt needes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, but then it was not. The Apoſtles did vſe it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt the diſeaſes of the bodie, but this Oyle is in the Popiſh church, vſed eſpecially for a remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſickeneſſes of the ſoule. Therefore, I graunt it was in thoſe dayes a ſigne of health of bodie, whileſt God left with his church that gift of healing, but it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a ſigne of ſpirituall grace, which is it that now they do affirme.</p>
                     <p>As for the health of the bodie, they ſo little regarde that it ſhould be vſed to that ende, that they muſt not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe annoyle them, but ſuch as they haue no hope that they may eſcape. Whereas the Apoſtle ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> would haue it done to that ende, that God forgiuing them their ſinnes, which are many times the cauſe of ſickeneſſe, they might be <hi>Healed,</hi> as ſaith ſaint <hi>Bede</hi> vpon this place. As for the promiſe which is a ſeconde thing that muſt be in a ſacrament,<note place="margin"> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace.</note> maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh no doubt but that he can proue it, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhal raiſe him vp, and if he haue ſinned, they ſhal be forgiuen him.</hi> The meaning of the apoſtle in this place is verie plaine,
<pb facs="tcp:13152:81"/> that wheras in the daies of the primitiue church, there were many myracles wrought by the apoſtles and others, they did not thoſe things, by any power which they had in them ſelues, but by the prayer of faith the ſicke were healed. And if their ſinnes were the cauſe of their ſickneſſe (as they are many times, although not alwayes,<note place="margin"> Iohn. 9.3</note> as by ſaint <hi>Iohns</hi> goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it appeareth) hee promiſeth that God, to the ende that they may not doubt but that they ſhall bee healed, will take away their ſinnes, and forgiue their offences, which otherwiſe might bee a let or hinderance. And that this condition is to be vnderſtoode in this promiſe, it is plaine by theſe wordes, <hi>And if you haue committed ſinnes:</hi> For the apoſtle nothing doubted but that they had ſinnes, <hi>For if wee ſay wee haue no ſinne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 1 Iohn. 1.8.</note> 
                        <hi>wee deceiue our ſelues, and there is no truth in vs.</hi> But hee might iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubt whether ſickeneſſe was alwayes layd vpon men, for, and in reſpect of their ſinnes. Therefore to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might haue ſinne or not, belongeth vnto them that knowe not the corruption of mans nature, which wee cannot thinke of the apoſtle ſaint <hi>Iames.</hi> But to knowe that God doeth not alwayes ſende afflictions in reſpect of ſinne: hee had learned by that which our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe ſayde vnto his Diſciples of the blind man, <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, neither his parents,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Iohn. 9.33</note> 
                        <hi>but that the workes of God may be manifeſt.</hi> And for this cauſe ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>If hee committed ſinnes, they ſhall be forgiuen him,</hi> that is, if his ſinnes haue beene the cauſe of his ſickeneſſe, his ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen him, that his ſickeneſſe may ceaſe. So then the promiſe of forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, which ſhould eſpecially ſerue to make this oyling a ſacrament, is but conditionall, whereas in the true ſacraments in deede, the promiſe of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is moſt certaine, otherwiſe wee ſhould not haue in the vſe of them any true comfort.</p>
                     <p>Thus then, ſeeing ſicknes ſometime commeth of ſinne, ſometime of other cauſes, the apoſtle ſayeth, if it come of
<pb facs="tcp:13152:82"/> ſinne, not onely the man ouer whom the elders make their faithfull prayer, and whom they ſo oynt with this viſible oyle, ſhal be raiſed vp, but alſo his ſinnes, the cauſe of his ſickneſſe ſhal be taken away. But that not forgiueneſſe of ſinnes was eſpecially regarded in this ceremonie, but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health, the fathers afore named doe proue, and maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot denie, but that ſundrie of the Papiſts do affirme, whileſt they teach that the Apoſtles in the 6. of ſaint <hi>Marke</hi> his Goſpell, did practiſe the ſelfe ſame thing that ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> commaundeth.<note place="margin"> The inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> But for the inſtitution of this ſacrament, maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can bring no proofe at all, but onely in reſpect of this promiſe of ſaint <hi>Iames,</hi> which if it be not of ſpirituall grace, as I truſt I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it is not, then is there no inſtitution of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be found. Then wee ſee that all this whole buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hangeth vpon a weake foundation, to bee grounded vpon one onely authoritie, and that ſo little to the purpoſe vnleſſe it be racked beſides the meaning: and that out of that Epiſtle, which although it be in our churches recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and read, yet we know that the authoritie thereof hath bin doubted of: and therefore the leſſe force hath it to proue any thing, that is not taught in any other place. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for their annoyling that is now vſed in the Popiſh church, which is farre vnlike that which the apoſtles vſed, there is in that place no proofe at all. And as maſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> hath the better lyking to expounde this place of ſaint <hi>Iames,</hi> of another oynting than the apoſtles vſed, marke eth ſixt chapter,<note place="margin"> Cap. 2</note> becauſe, as hee ſaieth <hi>Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,</hi> and <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> doe take both places for one annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: euen ſo doe I, and that with much better reaſon miſlike the Popiſh anoyling, becauſe it commeth ſo neare vnto that practiſe of the heretikes of whom <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin"> li. 1. cap. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>That they redeeme their dead at the ende of their race or trauell, powring oyle and water vpon their heads.</hi> And whereas maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would proue out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that this oyntment was vſed when they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13152:82"/> were dead. And therefore therein they differ from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, yet ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke of hereſies, ſaieth,<note place="margin"> Cap. 16.</note> they did it when they were dying. So that maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> muſt not thinke ſo to face out the matter, as if thoſe heretikes were nothing like them. And whereas they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed water alſo with their Oyle, although they differ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from the church of Rome, yet the difference is nothing ſo great by many degrees, betweene the Papiſts and thoſe heretikes, as is betweene the apoſtles and the papiſts for this poynt, as maie appeare by that which before hath beene ſaide.<note place="margin"> De ſacra. vnct. li. 2. cap. 4.</note> But after this great ſcarcitie of proofe out of the ſcriptures, hee commeth at length to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of man. And hee will prooue what men will ſay in his behalfe, where God keepeth ſilence. And the firſt that he bringeth in is <hi>Innocentius</hi> that liued at the leaſt foure hundred yeares after Chriſt. What, was it no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for foure hundred yeares, and nowe vpon a ſudden is it become a ſacrament? howe doeth hee proue it to bee a ſacrament? He bringeth no reaſon, hee hath no proofe, no, neither yet doeth hee ſo much as ſay it is a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly ſo called, but that it is <hi>Genus Sacramenti, <hi>A kinde of Sacrament.</hi>
                        </hi> What then, if we graunt to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that which Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſayeth? If it bee a kinde of Sacrament, as hee ſayeth, is it, therefore a ſacrament truely and properly as maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaieth? I denie that argument, and maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not proue it. And yet to helpe his bad cauſe, hee lowdly and lewdly belyeth <hi>Innocentius</hi> his woordes, in that hee affirmeth that <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſaieth expreſſelie and plainlie, that this oynting is that ſacrament explaned by ſaint <hi>Iames.</hi> But <hi>Innocentius</hi> hath no ſuch wordes, no neither yet any thing like. But M. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to deceiue them that can not looke into the fathers, doth many times falſifie them to make his cauſe to ſeeme better.</p>
                     <p>And nowe what cauſe hath this ſeconde <hi>Achylles</hi> of the Catholikes (for <hi>Eckius</hi> did beſtow that name firſt vpon
<pb facs="tcp:13152:83"/> himſelfe, as you may ſee in his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> in the title of the church in the margent) what cauſe I ſaie, hath this challenging champion thus to brag againſt <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> that hee durſt not ſo much as name this <hi>Innocentius.</hi> When his teſtimonie is examined, the cracke is great, but he doth not hit the marke that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue him to leauell at. As for <hi>Kemnitius</hi> if he haue but his due praiſe, we muſt needes confeſſe, that by his learning and trauell, he hath more beaten downe the walles of that popiſh Babilon, than that all the papiſts if they ioine togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand in hand, ſhall be able with all their ſkill and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to raiſe it vp againe. Of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came ſo late he is not worth the anſwering: for he liued about <hi>1200.</hi> yeares after Chriſt in time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and much ſuperſtition. As for the Councels which he alleageth, the firſt is the Nicene councell tranſlated into latine out of the Arabic tongue. But ſince that canon is not amongſt thoſe canons, which wee haue in the tomes of the councels, and in thoſe coppies that hitherto haue beene counted the true councels, we neede not much regarde thoſe farre fetched authorities. His ſecond authoritie is out of the councell of <hi>Cabilon,</hi> and ſome other particular coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and although he commend their antiquitie, yet the firſt of them was almoſt <hi>800.</hi> yeares after Chriſt. And thoſe which I haue examined, make not for his purpoſe. For they proue not, that this annointing is a ſacrament properly ſo called. Now for the fathers, maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> needeth no aduerſary, he confeſſeth his want of proofe out of them: For he deuideth the fathers into two ſortes. The one he confeſſeth doe not plainly ſaie that it is a ſacrament. Why then doth he produce them? He hath taken in hand to proue that anoyling, as it is vſed in the popiſh church, is a true and proper ſacrament. If they will not proue this, they maie holde their tongues. For to this end only are they to be alleaged. An other ſort there are, who ſpeake it plainely, as he telleth vs. But they are of no credit, neither
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13152:83"/> are once named among the ancient fathers. The eldeſt of them is about <hi>800.</hi> yeares after Chriſt. And for his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſome few men what they haue done, it is no proofe to vs, that we ought ſo to doe. They might haue their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that might well induce them to it. They might alſo doe therein, as in many things many haue done of a blinde zeale, and fooliſh deuotion. How or in what ſort they haue done that which they did, I wil not take vpon me to iudge: as for their doings they ought not to be an example to any man, ſo that we ſhould be bound to follow them. But hee wil proue by reaſon, that it muſt needs be a ſacrament:<note place="margin"> Bellarm. de ſac. vnct. li. 1. cap. 5.</note> For ſince God hath by a ſacrament holpen vs, in the entraunce into the church, and alſo in our continuance in the ſame, we maie not imagine that his prouidence ſhall faile vs at our going out of the church: theſe are maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his wordes. I might briefly anſwere, that we are not to teach God what we thinke conuenient that he ſhould doe, but to ſee what he hath done, and to content our ſelues therewith, and to frame our ſelues to performe the ſame. But if God faile in his prouidence, if their anoyling be not a ſacrament, then muſt we imagine that God had no due regarde of the fathers of the old world, or of the patriarkes, or of the godly vnder the law. For vntill Chriſts time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will confeſſe they had not this Sacrament. Yea the Apoſtles and all other the Godly and conſtant Martirs in Chriſts church, had not that ſacrament. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet did they make complaint for want of the ſame, but comfortably and patiently indured all torments with great ioy, although they had not this anoyling, nor anie hope to haue it, no neither once thought of it. Laſtly, our Sauiour Chriſt to prepare vs againſt death telleth vs, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeueth in him ſhall not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life: and to cauſe vs not to feare it, he ſaith, that he is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the life. Many notable leſſons did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt giue to his diſciples, before he left the world to goe to his father, which are recorded by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13152:85"/> from the twelfth to the ſeuenteenth chapters. And although he vſe all arguments to comfort them, yet he neuer once thought of this anoyling, which yet then if he had purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to leaue vnto his church anie ſuch Sacrament, it had beene good time to haue deliuered them for their comforte. To be ſhort, whatſoeuer he commaunded vs to vſe for the ſtrengthning of our faith, with boldneſſe we may, and with comfort and readineſſe we ought to doe: But it is farre from either true or ſound comfort, in the agony of death, or a ſufficient weapon, to withſtand the aſſaults of Sathan, and conflicts of conſcience, to haue ſtanding by thee ſome Idol paſtor, whoſe greateſt good, that he either can or will doe vnto thee, is to greaſe ſome parts of thy body. Let the world eſteeme of theſe things as they will. But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that it is only true obedience that hath the promiſe of bleſſing. And without the commandement there can be no obedience, either in our duties towardes God, or our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation amongſt men. For obedience is nothing els, but an earneſt applying of our ſelues to doe that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto God, and which he hath commanded. It is alſo far from the maieſtie of Gods ſpirit, to deliuer to vs ſuch trifling toyes, thereby to comfort the afflicted conſcience. And thus I truſt it appeareth, that this their ſacrament of anoyling, is but a deuiſe of their owne braine, hauing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtitution from Chriſt, neither any commaundement from his apoſtles, or example in the ſcriptures, eſpeciallie as it is now vſed in the church of Rome, either for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof it muſt conſiſt, or the manner how it muſt bee done, or the end vnto which they eſpecially haue regard in that ceremony.</p>
                     <p>I had thought here to haue ended both this treatiſe of the ſacraments and this chapter, but before I go anie far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would haue the chriſtian reader to marke the euill dealing of the popiſh church, who with their tongues and pennes proclaime as lowd as they can, that our doctrine is not catholicke, it is new, is lately deuiſed. And yet we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13152:85"/> appeale to the ſcriptures, &amp; haue teſtimony for vs alſo, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the fathers of the purer times. And on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary the church of Rome crieth ſtil, they are the catholick church, they haue the catholicke religion, yea all that is with them is catholicke. But if by the rules of catholicke which <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Lyrinenſis</hi> giueth,<note place="margin"> Commoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus haereſes.</note> (with whoſe authority they ſeek often to ſtoppe our mouthes) we examine their doctrines: we ſhall finde them as farre from the catholicke religion, as the prieſts and rulers amongſt the Iews were from the truth. For whereas he accounteth no doctrine catholicke, but that which hath beene taught at all times, in all places, and by all men, or at the leaſt by the moſt, and the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and godlieſt men, wee might by this rule reiect manie of their doctrines, which they deliuer to vs as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke and neceſſarie, ſo that without beleeuing them there is no ſaluation. For ſhortneſſe ſake, let vs looke into this that laſt I handled. They will haue it a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke doctrine to teach that anoyling is a true and proper Sacrament, yea, and the councell of Trent curſeth them that ſaie the contrarie. And yet maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who ſaith as much in effect as they all can ſaie in this point, how catholickely doth hee proue it? He with much adoe wreſteth for it one place out of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and hath not one mo in all the Scripture for him. Then leapeth hee more then foure hundreth yeares after Chriſt, and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out one pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> who ſaith it is a kinde of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. If he had proued it to be a Sacrament properly ſo called, yet had he beene but one witneſſe in foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares. Then about <hi>1200.</hi> years after Chriſt, he hath gotten another witnes, and he is a pope alſo, <hi>Innocent</hi> the third. Then he telleth vs of the <hi>69.</hi> canon of the councell of Nice, which had in al but twenty canons. Al aboue twenty were fetched out of Arabia, but are neither me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the Nicene councel ſet forth by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues,<note place="margin"> Li. 1. cap. 6.</note> neither yet of <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, where he ſetteth downe the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of that councel, who although he make <hi>22.</hi> in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:13152:86"/> Yet is the matter no other than is ſet downe in the <hi>1.</hi> booke of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels in thoſe <hi>20.</hi> chapters. Beſides there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſtrong reaſons, &amp; pregnant preſumptions to proue thoſe <hi>50.</hi> canons (for they haue <hi>70.</hi>) to be falſly added to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> councel, &amp; therfore they deſerue no credit. He alſo alledgeth ſome particular councels, which he commendeth for their antiquitie, and yet the ancienteſt of them, is about <hi>800.</hi> yeares after Chriſt. And about that time alſo are the moſt ancient fathers, that ſeeme to ſay any thing for him. Then if thou knoweſt the ſunne to ſhine at noone day, thou maiſt alſo know that this is not a catholicke doctrine, neither can be ſo accompted. It hath not beene taught at all times, not in al places, not by al or the moſt of the learned. No, it hath had ſcarce one ſufficient witnes in <hi>1200.</hi> yeares. But for the ſubſtance of religion which we teach, if we haue not a vniuerſal conſent of the ſcriptures, and alſo the teſtimony of the fathers of the church, in her moſt pure times, we craue no credit, we aſke no hearing. Therefore that which wee teach is the only catholicke faith, becauſe it hath the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall conſent of the purer times: that which for the moſt part they teach, is but new, not warranted by the word, not known or not taught amongſt the godly fathers, at the leaſt for <hi>400.</hi> or <hi>500.</hi> yeares. Which I thought good vpon this occaſion thus offered, to note vnto the chriſtian reader, that I might pull away from the faces of thoſe counterfeites, the viſard of catholicke, vniuerſality, antiquity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that their religion may appeare indeede as it is, new, not old, particular not catholicke, falſe not true: becauſe it is the deuiſe of man, whoſe wiſedom is folly, whoſe words are lies: and not the wil of God, which is the infallible rule, and of whoſe word not one title ſhall periſh. And thus I truſt it appeareth, that they who brag moſt, of the name of catholicke church, are the greateſt enemies to true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religion, teaching that which is nothing leſſe then catholicke.</p>

But the words themſelues do moſt plainely ſhew, that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this place of that part of man, wherein ſinne properly ſo called may be: for he ſpeaketh of that part of man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in raigning ſinne may be, otherwiſe his exhortation were needleſſe: but raigning ſinne, is ſinne properly ſo called, as all doe confeſſe, therefore ſinne properly ſo called, may be in this mortall body, whereof heere the Apoſtle ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh. And therefore Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth too haſtily, when as he concludeth, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainely ſignifieth hee calleth concupiſcence ſinne, but not properly, but vnproperly. But I may more iuſtly conclude againſt Maſter <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh there of ſinne properly ſo called. And he ſpeake h of concupiſcence: therefore concupiſcence is ſin properly ſo called. The <hi>minor</hi> is confeſſed here by maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in that he doth alleage it to proue his purpoſe of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The <hi>maior</hi> alſo is proued out of maſter <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For, the principall thing that he doth alleadge to teach vs, that Concupiſcence is no ſinne: that it is not in that ſame part wherein ſinne can bee, but in the fleſh onely, where
<pb facs="tcp:13152:89"/> can be no ſinne. But if it bee founde once to bee in that part of man wherein ſinne may bee, hee will not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but is alſo ſinne. Therfore thus I reaſon, the apoſtle ſpeaketh there of that ſinne that is in that part of the body,<note place="margin"> De amiſſ. grat. l. 5. c. 13</note> wherein ſinne is, that is properly ſo called, as before I haue proued: therfore he ſpeaketh of ſinne properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The other place alledged by maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to proue that ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> calleth not concupiſcence ſinne in the proper ſignification,<note place="margin"> Rom. 7.18.</note> is this, <hi>There dwelleth not in me, that is, in my fleſh, anie good.</hi> Therefore concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is in the fleſh. How vnneceſſarie a conſequence this argument hath, the verie children may perceiue. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo this word fleſh, euerie one that is acquainted but with the principles of diuinitie knoweth to be ſpoken of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is not regenerate in man, euen the verie mind of man. But of this I haue ſpoken ſufficiently in the anſwer to the former place. Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo vſeth ſome other reaſons to proue that the apoſtles calleth concupiſcence ſinne vnproperly but they are not worth ſpeaking of. As this is one. Sinne is manie times called vnproperly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here it is not called ſinne properly. A kinde of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> immediately afterwardes reproueth in <hi>Luther,</hi> and yet himſelfe vſeth it. Another reaſon whereby I proue concupiſcence to be ſinne in the proper ſignification,<note place="margin"> Rom. 7.23. De Amiſſ. gratiae li. 5. cap. 6.</note> is becauſe <hi>It rebelleth againſt the lawe of the minde.</hi> For maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that to be vnderſtoode of concupiſcence. As alſo by <hi>The law of the minde,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Ibid. cap. 10</note> he vnderſtandeth <hi>The rule of a good action,</hi> which muſt needes be the law of God. Thus therefore I reaſon, whatſoeuer affection or luſt rebelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of the minde, is in truth ſinne: but concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is luſt that rebelleth againſt the law of the minde, therefore concupiſcence is in truth ſinne. The <hi>maior</hi> may be proued out of ſaint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 1. Iohn. 3.4.</note> who defineth ſin to be a <hi>Breach of law, or lawleſneſſe.</hi> But yet maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wil not confeſſe that whatſoeuer rebelleth againſt the law is ſinne
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13152:89"/> properly, and namely concupiſcence,<note place="margin"> De Amiſſ. grat. li. 5. cap 14.</note> becauſe it rebelleth onely as a thing ſtirring vp, and cauſing to tranſgreſſe, as I ſaid of the diuell (ſaith he.) I am glad that concupiſcence which the papiſts will in no wiſe to be ſinne of it ſelfe, hath deſerued no better of her owne friends and patrons, then to be matched in the ſame yoke with the diuell, <hi>who is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and the father thereof.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Iohn. 8.44.</note> But maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot ſhift off this argument vnder this coulour. Wee inquire what concupiſcence is, he telleth vs what it worketh, wee would knowe the nature of it, he telleth vs, the effect of it. There are therefore in concupiſcence two things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: the one is, what it bringeth foorth in vs, of the which we ſay with ſaint <hi>Iames,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Iam. 1.15.</note> 
                        <hi>When luſt hath concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it bringeth forth ſin.</hi> The other, what it is in it ſelfe, or in it own nature. To that we anſwere out of the apoſtle in many places, that it is ſin, as before it hath bin ſhewed: yea and in this very reſpect, that it hath in it a repugnancy againſt the law of the minde, and followeth not the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law of God. For euen as it is crooked, that is, not euen to the ſtraite rule: ſo is it ſinne, that is, not agreeable to the moſt infallible rule of Gods law, which I take to be maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> meaning, expounding the nature of the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which ſaint <hi>Iohn</hi> vſeth,<note place="margin"> De Amiſſ. grat. li. 5. cap. 14 1. 1. Iohn. 3.4</note> he ſaith <hi>It is a departing from the law.</hi> If then concupiſcence be examined, euen before it bee conſented vnto, by Gods Lawe doe wee not finde that it is a motion diſagreeing from Gods Lawe? No man can denie it. For looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the luſt that mooueth to vncleanneſſe, to ſtealth, to crueltie, although the heart conſent not, yet in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie luſt, is that, that diſagreeth from Gods Lawe. So that this is not true that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence rebelleth againſt the lawe onelie, as it ſtirreth vp or cauſeth to ſinne: ſeeing in it ſelfe it hath that nature that ſwarueth from the law.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> alſo proueth my <hi>maior</hi> in that definition that
<pb facs="tcp:13152:90"/> he giueth of ſinne,<note place="margin"> Cont. Fauſt. li. 22. cap. 27.</note> ſaying, that <hi>Sinne is that which is ſaid, done, or luſted againſt the eternall law.</hi> And that that is a definition of ſinne, properly ſo called, maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot denie. Nowe for my <hi>minor</hi> propoſition, which is this, That concupiſcence rebelleth againſt the lawe of the minde, maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth it in plaine wordes,<note place="margin"> De Amiſſ. gratiae. lib. 5 cap. 10. &amp; 14</note> but yet ſo, as that he ſeemeth to mee to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Iuglers, when they would play a tricke of leger-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. For their greateſt ſkill is <hi>Deceptio viſus, <hi>the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of our ſight,</hi>
                        </hi> whereby they ſeeme to do that they doe not, or with a little cleanly conueyance, to beguile the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For although he confeſſe, that theſe luſts rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawe,<note place="margin"> De Amiſſ. gratiae. li. 5. cap. 10.</note> yet ſaith he, they rebell againſt the law as it ſheweth the ende, not as it commaundeth the meanes. But who can imagine that euer ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaking of this point of Diuinitie, which is moſt neceſſarie to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of euerie one, euen from the higheſt, to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, would ſpeake or write ſo ſubtilly or obſcurely? And who tolde him theſe luſts ſtriue not againſt the lawe, as it commaundeth the meanes, that is to ſay, as it commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to reſiſt, and not to yeeld to them? Doubtleſſe that luſt, which rebelleth againſt this commaundement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> will neuer yeeld when it is reſiſted: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing naturally ſeeketh the preſeruation of it ſelfe. But the reſiſting of luſt is the deſtruction of it, therefore it will not yeeld to it. And as reaſon teacheth this, ſo ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> by experience found it to be true, when hee ſaide, <hi>Sinne tooke occaſion by the commaundement,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Rom. 7.23.</note> 
                        <hi>and wrought in mee all maner of concupiſcence.</hi> So that this concupiſcence, is by reſiſting, made more ſtubburne, and is ſo farre from yeelding, that it fighteth more fiercely againſt the lawe. And hereof is that combat and battell, which the godly haue betweene the fleſh and the ſpirite. The wicked are not acquainted with it, becauſe they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeelde to their luſts. But the godly, becauſe they reſiſt the ſame, <hi>Doe ſee another lawe in their members,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13152:90"/> rebelling againſt the lawe of their minde.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Rom. 7.23</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee that this diſtinction whereby maſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſtriueth againſt trueth, is neither according to the meaning of the Apoſtle, nor hath any colour of trueth. But here by the way I muſt note, how groſſely, and how abſurdly maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the place next before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged affirmeth, that he is not a ſinner, that attaineth not to the ende of the commaundement. His reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it lieth not in his power: no more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is too blame, that being commaunded to ſubdue the enemies, can not do it. But maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould conſider where is the cauſe of this want in vs, and through whoſe fault it is that wee can not obey this commaundement, thou ſhalt not luſt. If it bee in man, as in trueth it is, becauſe hee fell from that eſtate of innocencie wherein hee was created, then is there no reaſon, but that ſinne ſhould bee imputed vnto vs, for not performing that commaundement, <hi>thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> And by this alſo it appeareth, that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his ſimilitude is nothing like, becauſe that the ſubduing of the enemie was not in their power. But not to luſt wickedly was in mans power once, which becauſe through his owne fault hee loſt, the not fulfilling of that commaundement, may iuſtly bee layde to his charge for ſinne. Thirdly, I thus proue concupiſcence to be ſinne: <hi>Not to loue the Lorde our God, with all our heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Luke. 10.27</note>

For not only the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular writers among them, excuſe from ſinne the actions of Infidels,<note place="margin"> Seſſ. 6. can. 57.</note> but alſo the councell of Trent doth hold them all accurſed that dare ſay they are truly ſinne. But their feare is, leaſt if the nature of man be ſet forth in her owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and duely conſidered of, the doctrine of merite by workes will ſeeme more abſurd. But if the workes of graceleſſe and godleſſe men, may be thought to be voide of ſinne: how much the rather maie we thinke, that the works of the faithfull may be ſo perfect, that they may merite at Gods handes? And in truth no man can denie, but that there is no compariſon, betweene the workes of the godlie and the vngodly. Therefore that they may prepare a way for their doctrine of merites, they would firſt make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that euen in the wicked there may be good workes. And leaſt men ſhould condemne the corruption of this our nature, being not renued by the ſpirit of God, as it iuſtlie deſerueth, and ſo ſincerely confeſſe, that we haue in vs no good, but that it commeth wholy from God: the councell of Trent doth not any thing miſlike thoſe opinions, that commend the works euen of infidels, yea attributing ſome merit vnto them, as doe ſome of the ſcholemen, but onlie accurſeth them that accompt them to be ſinne.<note place="margin"> Sleiden. comment. li. 23.

Theſe bald proofes, doe ſhew that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath but a barren matter in hande. For by doing the lawe, he meaneth not that which the Apoſtle calleth fulfilling of the law,<note place="margin"> Rom. 23.8.</note> for the Gentiles not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cannot doe that. But that they doe that which the lawe commaundeth after ſome ſort, but not in ſuch manner as is commaunded. And therefore hee ſaith they doe the worke of the law. But that worke of the law, becauſe they
<pb facs="tcp:13152:94"/> doe it not, with ſuch a minde, and to ſuch an end as they ought, therefore it is ſinne in them. And that the apoſtle himſelfe in that place ſheweth. For his endeuour is to proue, them to be vnexcuſeable by reaſon of their ſinne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had not the law written deliuered to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had by nature the ſubſtance which he calleth the worke of the law, written in their harts: yea, and framed very often their external actions according to the ſame and yet performed not that holy obedience that they ſhould. Now who wil grant ſuch an argument? The Gentiles do the external law: therefore there is not ſinne in al their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

The firſt is this. If works done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith or Gods ſpeciall helpe, be ſinne, they are ſinne, either becauſe they are not done to the right end, which is Gods glorie: or becauſe they proceed from a ſinfull man: or becauſe thoſe morall workes are not of proportion with the ſtrength of nature: or laſtly, becauſe theſe workes that are good are too hard, both in reſpect of the rebellion of the fleſh, and the tyranny of Sathan. But in none of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects they are ſinne: therefore they are not ſinne. Which his argument briefly thus I anſwer. That his <hi>minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is vtterly falſe, and directly againſt that which the Apoſtle ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth in the Epiſtle to the Romanes, of the Gentiles, ſhewing how God gaue them vp, becauſe <hi>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Rom. 1.21.</note> Wherein the Apoſtle ſheweth how wickedly the Gentiles abuſe that their knowledge, whereby they ſhould be moued to glorifie God. And in that he denieth that they can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſinfull, becauſe they proceede from ſinfull man. What doth hee elſe, but giue the lie to our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, who hath plainely ſaide,<note place="margin"> Matth. 7.19.</note> that <hi>an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil tree cannot bring forth good fruit</hi> And all the ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath, can not ſalue this ſore. For it is impoſſible to gather grapes of thiſtles: for that he ſpeaketh of the proportion, betweene the worke and the ſtrength of nature, it would be too long heere to examine. Laſtly, whereas hee accounteth the tyranny of Sathan, and ſubiection to their owne luſtes, not to be ſufficient to make their worke ſinfull: let him ſee how hee can anſwer, not <hi>S. Paul</hi> onely, who ſaith, that ſuch are ſeruants to ſin, but alſo our ſauiour Chriſt, who telleth the Iewes,<note place="margin"> Rom. 6.17.</note> that vnleſſe the Sonne made them free, they could not be free. Then I pray you, what good works,<note place="margin"> Ioh. 8.36.</note> wholy void of ſin can ſuch worke as ſerue ſo bad a M. as is ſin?

                     <p> If the Infidels in doing their good workes, do ſinne, it is better for them not to do thoſe workes, than to do them: but ſo to ſay is moſt abſurde. That to ſay it is better not to do thoſe externall good workes than to doe them, wee will with maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> willingly confeſſe. But how doeth hee prooue his <hi>maior,</hi> namely, that it is better to leaue them vndone, than to doe them? Becauſe in doing them (ſaieth he) they ſinne, in not doing them, they ſinne not.<note place="margin"> De amiſſ. grat. li. 1. ca. 2</note> I ſee Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath forgotten that which in an other place hee telleth vs, that a man ſinneth aſwell in not doing that hee ſhould, as in dooing that hee ſhoulde not.

And for the meaning of it, to the ende it ſhoulde not ſeeme to prooue that, for the which it is alleadged in this queſtion, Maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> hath three anſweres to that place.<note place="margin"> De gratia &amp; lib a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which anſwere of his, doth flatly deny that which Chriſt affirmeth, Chriſt ſaith, An euill tree can not bring foorth good fruit: yes, ſaith Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (by your leaue) but it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Euery tree is knowen by the fruit (ſaith Chriſt:)
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13152:95"/> not ſo, (ſaith maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) for ſometimes the fruit may be good, although the tree be euill. Is not this a ſawcie mate, ſo impudently and openly to controll the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all trueth? His ſecond anſwer, if we will truſt his owne report, is a plaine ſolution of the argument. And it is this, that this euil tree is the euil wil of man.<note place="margin"> De actis cum fol. Manich. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> Which anſwer he would faine father vpon ſaint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but in the place alledged there is no ſuch matter. I remember that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in another place doth ſay,<note place="margin"> De gratia Chriſti ca. 18</note> that this euill tree, is a man of an euill will, but not the euill will it ſelfe. Well, thus maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> granteth this place to bee true, that an euill tree, that is, luſt, or a man that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to luſt, cannot bring foorth good fruit. But firſt maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath falſified <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> as I haue ſaide: Secondly, he expoundeth this place otherwiſe than ſaint <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Theoph.</hi> doe: for they vnderſtand it euen as we doe, that an euill man, whileſt he is euill, can not bring foorth good fruit, but being conuerted hee may. Yea the wordes themſelues are very plaine, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Chriſt meant it not of the euil wil that is in man, but of the man himſelfe: in that he addeth,<note place="margin"> Luc. 6.45.</note> 
                        <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good, and an euill man out of the euill treaſure of his heart bringeth foorth euill.</hi> Yet then this place alleadged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſubſtantially, that Infidelles or heathen men whileſt they continue ſo, can not do any workes that ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good or voide of ſinne. His third and laſt anſwere to this place is this. The euill tree (ſaith he) is an euil man, and the good fruit is a meritorious worke. And after this meaning he thus anſwereth the place. An euill man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do a meritorious worke. Is not this a notable abuſing of Gods word, after his owne pleaſure to wreſt and wring it? what one word induceth him to dreame here of merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workes? Nay the words confute him mightily: for it is ſaid, <hi>An euil tree bringeth forth euill fruit.</hi> Euill,<note place="margin"> Matth. 7.17.</note> I ſay, not onely, not meritorious. And the tree is knowen
<pb facs="tcp:13152:96"/> by the fruit. The fruit then muſt be bad that muſt ſhew a bad tree. And therefore this anſwere of M. <hi>Bellar.</hi> is, as are the reſt too fooliſh.<note place="margin"> De gra. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti cap. 18. 19 Cont.

For if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, yet he doth them euill, thou canſt not deny, but that he ſinneth that doth any thing euill. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wilt not ſay that he ſinneth in doing this, thou wilt doubtles ſay, that both he doth good things, and he doth them well.</hi> Now marke <hi>S.

Againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt ſaide, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſinne of the worlde.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Iohn 1.29.</note> This alſo, to our ſingular great comfort we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he taketh away both the condemnation or curſſe, and alſo the guiltineſſe or corruption of our ſinne: And therefore hee is truely ſayde to take away the ſinne of the worlde. Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould prooue, that this is perfectly done in baptiſme, ſo that no ſinne after baptiſme remaineth, but this proueth no ſuch matter. No not one of all theſe places make any mention of baptiſme. Only they teſtifie, that either ſinne is, or the godly would haue it abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, which we alſo confeſſe and deſire. But how, or when it is taken away, there is not any mention in the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. Let vs then come to the laſt proofe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſts loue to the church his ſpouſe, ſayth: <hi>He gaue himſelfe for it, that he might ſanctifie it and cleanſe it,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Ephe. 5.25 26, 27</note> 
                        <hi>by the waſhing of water in the worde: that he might make it vnto himſelfe a grorious church, not hauing ſpot or wrinkle, &amp;c.</hi> Now if I ſhould expound this place,<note place="margin"> Ezec. 47.</note> by the 47. Chapter of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:13152:98"/> vnto the which the apoſtle may verie well ſeeme to allude, I knowe this expoſition would be thought newe, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. But yet as this expoſition hath nothing in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rule of faith, ſo by ſaint <hi>Ieroms</hi> interpretation of that place of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> it ſeemeth to be warranted. For by the waters mentioned in that place, hee vnderſtandeth that which our ſauiour Chriſt taught, as alſo both hee and <hi>Primaſius</hi> doe expound this place of the apoſtle, <hi>As wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (ſay they) <hi>waſheth the bodie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Ierom &amp; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius vpon Epheſ. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>ſo teaching doeth cleanſe the ſoule.</hi> And ſo the apoſtle doth ſeeme to expound himſelfe, when hee ſheweth that this waſhing is in the worde. And thus this place ſerueth no more for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then the reſt. For none of them proue that baptiſme taketh away all ſinne. But admit that ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in that place of baptiſme, yet this place will not ſerue to proue that they would haue it. For then the apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, how the church of Chriſt, I ſay, that complete and whole bodie of Chriſt is ſanctified, namely by himſelfe in the worde, whereof baptiſme is the ſacrament. So that therein appeareth how, or rather by what meanes, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt, his wife and ſpouſe ſhall be without ſpot and wrinkle, but not in what maner, or in what compaſſe of time, euerie particular member of this bodie ſhall be freed from ſinne, which is in controuerſie amongſt vs. But to ende this firſt argument. As this doctrine of the Romiſh Church ſauoureth of Pelagianiſme: ſo maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his fellowes borrow weapons of the Pelagians to fight withall. For ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth note this place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe which the Pelagians did alledge to proue that man may be without ſinne.<note place="margin"> De perfect. iuſt. cont.

                        <hi>The Pelagians doe ſay that men by baptiſme are perfectly renued, and bring for proofe the witneſſe of the Apoſtle to the Epheſ.</hi> 5. Not one ape is then liker another, than are the Pelagians and Papiſts, both in their doctrine, and in their proofe of it. But of all ſuch teſtimonies I may ſay with ſaint <hi>Auguſt.

                        <hi>that they run as they ſhoulde, ſome other ſhewe to what ende they ſhould runne.</hi> And thus much for his firſt argument. His ſecond argument is this.<note place="margin"> Arg. 2. of M. <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                        </note> The Scriptures ſay, that our ſpots, defilings, or pollutions, and our iniquities are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, therefore in baptiſme all ſinne is taken away. For by theſe wordes is ſignified (ſaith hee) the verie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſinne. His argument is not good. For we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his antecedent, namely, that theſe things are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as before hath beene ſhewed. But it followeth not thereupon, that by baptiſme all ſinne is taken away: wee acknowledge alſo that Chriſt is made vnto vs <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> but in deed this holineſſe wee ſay is not in this life perfected.<note place="margin"> 1.

Iuſt. Celeſt. De Amiſſ. gratiae. li. 5 cap. 8</note> and namely in the end of his booke of the perfection of Iuſtice: which place I the rather note, becauſe moſt vntruly maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writeth, that ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in that place ſaith, <hi>That the vnwilling motions of concupiſcence, are ſo farre from being ſinne, that a man neede not for the forgiueneſſe of them ſay, Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes:</hi> But ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the contrary.

                        <note place="margin"> 1. Iohn 1.8</note> 
                        <hi>If we ſay we haue no ſin, we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs:</hi> then he addeth, that if any will ſay, that the apoſtle ſpeaketh there of concupiſcence, &amp; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence if it be not conſented vnto, is not ſinne, <hi>He put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a ſubtill difference,</hi> which I would haue our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to marke, that they may know that S. <hi>Aug.</hi> counteth that but a ſubtill ſhift. And then he ſheweth that we do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſomewhat conſent to the luſts of that ſinne, becauſe otherwiſe we needed not to ſay, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes.</hi> So that we ſee ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maketh that a reaſon to prooue, that concupiſcence often preuaileth, becauſe wee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13152:99"/> haue neede ſo to pray. And thus we ſee how cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to all ſhew of trueth, maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> falſifieth ſaint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Which I would wiſh the ſimple to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of: For many times either himſelfe is ſo deceiued, or elſe hee ſeeketh to deceiue his Reader. But to returne to his argument, this we ſay, that euen here in this life, Gods children begin to haue a miſlike of ſin, &amp; a loue of godlines, yea, and alſo by the aſſiſtance of Gods good ſpirit increaſe therin. But this ſhal not be perfected in vs, vntill we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from this bodie of death,<note place="margin"> Rom. 7 Vpon Iohn tract. 41</note> and that made the apoſtle to crie out as he did. And therefore ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that none in this life can be without ſinne, <hi>yet ſinne is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the life of them that do profit, but conſumed it is in the life of the perfect:</hi> meaning after this life, when corruption hath put on incorruption, who then would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe of this reaſon. The verie filth and corruption of ſin, is taken away, therefore it muſt needes be taken away here by baptiſme. Whereas on the contrarie, we are called children of God, becauſe at the firſt, not in faith onely, but in life alſo we are beginners and weake, and muſt growe ſtronger and ſtronger in both. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg.  </seg>3</label> His third argument. In cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion the fleſh onely was cut away, not by imputation onely. Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> verie vnſkilfully doeth match togither things not of like nature. For as Circumciſion is the cutting off the foreſkinne, ſo is baptiſme the waſhing of the bodie. But this is nothing to the effect of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to tel vs what the externall thing doth of it ſelfe. Out of that that hath beene ſaid it is not hard to anſwer his <hi>4. 6. 7. 8,</hi> and <hi>9.</hi> arguments, if wee remember that God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in vs holines here, which ſhal be perfected elſe where. But in the meane time, for his Chriſts ſake, hee accepteth our vnperfect holineſſe for perfect, and forgiueth, euen the many and great ſinnes of his children. As for his fift argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Bella. De iuſtificat, li. 2. cap. 7. Rom. 5.19</note> which in another place he ſaith that it ſeemeth vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, euen in that reſpect that he truſteth ſo much in the ſtrength of it, I would not omit.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13152:100"/>
                     <p> And it is this, <hi>As by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, many are made iuſt.</hi> But ſaith he, by <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience we were made indeede ſinners, and not only by imputation: Therefore by Chriſt we are not by imputation only made righteous, but alſo indeed. What if I ſhould anſwere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that this word <hi>As,</hi> doth not ſignifie the likeneſſe in the maner of iuſtifying vs, but in the act it ſelfe. Namely, that many were partakers of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, and many were made righteous by Chriſt. For this word <hi>As,</hi> doth not alwaies import an agreement or likenes in euery point. Among many examples that may be alleadged, this one may ſerue for all.<note place="margin"> Ioh. 20.21.</note> 
                        <hi>As my father ſent me, ſo ſende I you.</hi> But God ſent him from heauen, to take vpon him a nature that he had not, with fulnes of al power and graces: the apoſtles were not ſo ſent. So that we ſee that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can not ſoundly reaſon becauſe of this worde <hi>As,</hi> that this contrariety betweene the firſt and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt hold in euery point. But what neede we to ſtand vpon ſo narrowe a point? Becauſe the argument pleaſeth him ſo wel, I wil yeeld to it, and confeſſe it to bee moſt true. And yet ſhall it nothing helpe maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> his cauſe. But in truth the ſumme of the doctrine that is taught in that place as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin"> De peceat. met. &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſ. li. c. 3 cap. 28.</note> it is this, That as al in <hi>Adam</hi> die in whom al ſinned, ſo they that are quickned, are quickned by Chriſt, in whom they are all iuſtified. But if hee will needes that this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of vs righteous whereof the apoſtle ſpeaketh, ſhould be by our ſanctification, I haue ſhewed that it cannot heere be perfect.

                        <note place="margin"> 1.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13152:100"/> to vs as ours: and that our aduerſaries wil in no wiſe heare vs ſpeake of that: they ſhall yet heare how Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> writeth, euen alluding vnto the wordes from whence this vnanſwerable argument in drawen. <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>could man the ſeruant of ſinne,</hi>

Therefore

                     <p>If then the impoſſibility of keeping the conditions, is by our owne fault, God may iuſtly require of vs that debt, which hee knoweth wee were able to pay, when firſt we became his debters. We ſee then, that it is neither a good argument, to ſay God promiſeth vpon condition, therfore wee can perfourme the condition: (for the condition doeth but ſhew, what we ought to doe, or what marke we muſt aime at, yea, and what wee muſt doe in the end) neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd that he ſhould require that of vs now, which once we could haue performed, and might ſtill haue done, if wee had not our ſelues bin in fault.

That manie of the fathers doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound theſe words ſo, it cannot be denied. But not what they ſay is only to be regarded, but how they proue it: yea the Ieſuites that wrote,<note place="margin"> In dialog. 2</note> the cenſure of Colen will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my warrant for they hauing condenmed ſome of the auncient fathers to haue ſpoken hardly, becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the workes of infidels, how good ſoeuer they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to be but ſinne, doe then fall to trie how their proofe will warrant their doctrine. So muſt I heere examine vpon what ground the fathers doe thus expound it. And this I need not feare to do. For themſelues giue me leaue to examine that they ſay. If then ſaint <hi>Hillarie</hi> haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs a true rule to interprete the ſcripture, when he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin"> Lib. 9. de trinit.</note>

                        <hi>as Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lirinenſis</hi> warneth vs. Firſt then, euen in reſpect of the verie Grammer, if the relatiue in both places muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the antecedent, then this worde <hi>(It)</hi> which is the relatiue in both places as they would haue it, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his or him, as we ſay, being of the Maſculine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which themſelues cannot denie, the worde <hi>(Sinne)</hi> which is of the Feminine Gender, cannot bee the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to thoſe Relatiues, although it goe next them, which maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vnlearnedly affirmeth. And therefore that tranſlation, and interpretation of the place, ſtandeth not with the rules of Grammer. Secondly, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the place, teach vs ſo much. <hi>Cain</hi> is angrie that his brothers ſacrifice is accepted of, and his not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God hath queſtioned with <hi>Cain</hi> of his anger, hee bringeth this as an argument to pacifie him, becauſe that <hi>Cain</hi> being the elder brother, ſhould ſtill haue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13152:105"/> of the elder brother: and <hi>Abell</hi> ſhould bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto him. And that this is the plaine and natural ſenſe of the wordes, I proue by ſundrie reaſons. Firſt, becauſe in the former Chapter, God ſpeaking of the ſubiection of <hi>Eue</hi> vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> as they cannot but confeſſe,<note place="margin"> Cap. 3.16.</note> vſeth the ſelfe ſame wordes there, that are here vſed. And therefore by all likelihoode hee ſpeaketh of the ſame matter alſo here, that there he did, howe <hi>Abell</hi> ſhould be vnder his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother. Conferre the wordes together, you ſhall ſee them agree.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, how impertinenly had the promiſe of free will, beene made in that place vnto <hi>Cain,</hi> God hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected his ſacrifice, and knowing his furie towards his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea not any one circumſtance inducing thereunto. But thirdly their owne doctrine doeth ſtrongly confute them. For if they that are not regenerate (as <hi>Cain</hi>) haue the power of their will, by their owne confeſſion weakened, and ſo clogged that they cannot haue free wil to doe good, then this cannot be verified of ſinne, howe could God ſay that the luſt or deſire of ſinne ſhould be vnder him, or that he ſhould haue dominion ouer ſinne, being a graceleſſe, and cruel man. Yea, the euent did preſently declare, that hee was ſubiect to ſinne, and that ſinne got the dominion ouer him. So that I cannot ſee how they can be excuſed, from ſeeking to make God a liar, that affirme that God there promiſed that <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould ſubdue ſinne, the euent being ſo plain contrary. Which becauſe I know it to be farre from thoſe godly fathers, I will rather thinke, that they did but allude vnto that place, then expound the words. And thus I truſt it is plaine, that neither the rules of Grammer, nor the circumſtances of the place, neither yet their owne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of free will, can well ſtand with that interpretation that they doe bring. As for his ſecond authoritie which is out of Eccleſiaſticus, the booke it ſelfe, not being canonical,<note place="margin"> Eccle. 15.14, 15, 16.</note> a neceſſarie argument cannot bee gathered out of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And that man at the firſt had free will it can not bee

                        <hi>Chooſe you this day whom you will ſerue,</hi> When <hi>Ioſue,</hi> who had good experience of the frailtie of the people, and their readineſſe to ſerue other gods, had ſet before them the great mercies of God, in their mightie deliuerance and preſeruation from many perils, the more ſtrongly to tie them vnto God, hee putteth them to this choiſe, not becauſe he would haue ſuffered them to haue worſhipped ſtrange gods, if themſelues would, (for that had beene contrarie to the dutie, that God required of him being a magiſtrate) but to this ende, that themſelues ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made choiſe to ſerue God, might by this their owne voluntarie ſubmitting themſelues to God, bee vrged to ſerue him more ſincerely, as by the <hi>22.</hi> verſe appeareth. And this choiſe alſo is rather what external profeſſion they would be of, which is a matter in our owne power, rather then of the inwarde affection, which is the thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betweene the Papiſts and vs. For this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and they ſhould proue, that wee are able by our free will to doe things that are truely good, and to eſchewe the things that are euill. And that this choyſe that they were put to, was what externall profeſſion they would be of, the wordes themſelues declare. <hi>Chooſe</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>whether ye will ſerue the Gods which your fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13152:106"/> or the gods of the Amorites, I and my houſe will ſerue the Lorde.</hi> As if a man would ſay now, chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will profeſſe the Goſpell or Poperie.

Whereas, if it proue any thing, it is but that which we neuer denied, namely that the wicked haue a free will to euill. Now that which he alledgeth out of ſaint <hi>Paul,</hi> is too abſurd: <hi>Neuertheleſſe he that purpoſeth firmely in his heart that he hath no need, but hath power ouer his owne will, &amp;c.</hi> What are theſe wordes to free will. The power y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> here he ſpeaketh of, is if he performe his purpoſe without inconuenience to his daughter, as may appeare not onely by <hi>Primaſius,</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> of this place,<note place="margin"> Primaſius.

So that in effect, this is his argument. His daughter doth not hinder his will for keeping her a virgin: therefore hee hath free will in himſelfe to doe good, or eſchew euill. Of the ſtrength of which argument, let maiſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne friendes conſider. His laſt place out of the ſcriptures is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie like this. <hi>As euerie man wiſheth in his owne heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 2. Cor. 9.7.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſpeaketh of the contribution to the Saints. <hi>You muſt</hi> (ſayeth ſaint <hi>Paul) giue willingly.</hi> Therefore ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> you haue free will. Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the regenerate haue a willingnes to do good, and eſchew euill, and this the apoſtle would haue in them. But doeth this prooue that they haue free will? And thus farre for their arguments for free will out of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Out of the fathers maſter <hi>Bellar.</hi> bringeth many proofes. And although there be iuſt cauſe, to ſuſpect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of them in this queſtion, becauſe they could not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget that which in the ſchooles of philoſophy they had learned: yet that it may appeare that they haue not ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb facs="tcp:13152:107"/> a conſent as they bragge of, it is not amiſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to looke into and to examine the proofes,<note place="margin"> Bellar. de grat. &amp; lib. arbit. lib. 5. cap. 25.</note> that out of them they bragge. But maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would make a man afraide to heare his crackes. Hee braggeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that his armour is of the beſt proofe that can not bee pearced, his arguments ſuch as can not be anſwered. And firſt commeth in <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Epiſt. de. mag.</note> whoſe wordes are ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable, that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeeth no way but to denie the Authour. But let maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> quiet him ſelfe, we will admit the authour. The effect of that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth out of the firſt place, is, <hi>that looke what men doe chooſe that they ſhal haue:</hi> and after, <hi>If a man do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is a man of the diuell, ſo made not by nature, but by the will of his minde.</hi> Then let vs ſee his argument: <hi>Looke what men doe chooſe, they ſhall goe into the place of that they chooſe,</hi> whether it bee life or death, ſo ſayeth <hi>Ignatius,</hi> therefore (ſaith maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> men haue free will. The force of both his places is this, and the argument that can bee gathered out of the ſame: men haue will: <hi>ergo</hi> they haue free will. And are theſe his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable arguments. That which hee alledgeth out of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita,</hi> although hee make as great bragges of it, as hee did of the other: yet it neuer ſo much as mentioneth free will.<note place="margin"> De diuinis nominibus li. 4. cap. 4. part. 4.</note> In deed he ſaith, <hi>If a man might not reſiſt ſinne, hee were leſſe to be blamed: But if hee that is good giue ſtrength, which as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach, doeth giue things conuenient ſimplie to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man, &amp;c.</hi> That God giueth conuenient ſtrength to them which with humilitie ſeeke it, but what doth this gift of God prooue that wee haue free will. It rather ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth it. For if we haue not ſtrength but by his gift, then we haue it not in vs, or by free will. As for <hi>Clement</hi> of Rome, becauſe himſelfe dare not ſpeake much for the trueth of that witneſſe, I let him paſſe. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in <hi>Iuſtine</hi> the Philoſopher and martyr, whoſe words for free will maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taketh to be ſo plaine, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13152:107"/> he ſaieth maiſter <hi>Caluine</hi> neither doeth, nor can feigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing, that will carrie any ſhewe of an anſwer. What neede we to feigne, Maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that haue the truth for our warrant. We leaue faigning to painters, poets, and papiſts, who loue alwayes to make a ſhew of that that is not. If we conſider the occaſions why the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did write in ſuch ſort, their meaning will bee pliane enough. And that may appeare by <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr</hi> here alledged. He ſaith, I grant.<note place="margin"> Apolog. ad ſenatum. Apol. ad An.</note> 
                        <hi>That if men haue not free will to ſhunne euill and doe good, they are not to blame for that they doe, and deſerue neither reward nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> Thus in effect hee ſaieth in the places alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>

Not becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:13152:108"/> they thinke, that man hath ſuch ability being once renued by grace, that he can doe what hee will, as the papiſtes teach, but they only impugne theſe Stoicall opinions that affirme that man doth of neceſſitie euill or good. And that this is the meaning of <hi>Iuſtine</hi> the Martir by his owne wordes doth plainly appeare, becauſe in both the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he ſetteth himſelfe to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would haue men thinke that all things were wrought by deſteny.

Thus haue I truely &amp; faithfully deliuered vnto thee (good reader,) the cauſe that maketh this and other of the ancient fathers eſpecially before <hi>Pelagius</hi> to write ſo plainelie for free will.<note place="margin"> De fide Or. thod. li 2. cap. 7.</note> As alſo may wel be gathered out of <hi>Damaſcene.</hi> For when as yet there were none ſprung vp, that did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute too much to free wil as afterward the Pelagians did; but there were on the contrary, many that did wholy take al wil from man: no maruel if they did wholy oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the daunger which they ſawe preſent before their eies.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13152:108"/> And now if the firſt fathers, did not ſo plentifully ſet forth mans weakenes, as they did his wil or power to do things, it is no maruell becauſe they neither knew Pelagians nor papiſtes, but them that erred in the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
                     <p>And this being wel conſidered of, maie ſerue I truſt to anſwere to whatſoeuer they can alleadge out of the fathers for free wil: &amp; may teach vs, that they cal it free, not as it is able, but as it is willing, to do good &amp; eſchew euil.<note place="margin"> De corrept. &amp; gra. cap. 2.

And thus much generally, for the true vnderſtanding of all the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the fathers that are alleadged by maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> not only in his fift booke,<note place="margin"> Cap. 25, 26, 27, 28.</note>

Whereas before he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to proue it in moral vertues. But becauſe that in the former, he did lay the foundation of that which in the ſixt he teacheth, and al belonged to that end. Namely, to the queſtion of free wil, which in this chapter I am to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, therefore haue I thought good to anſwere in this one place whatſoeuer he ſaith tending to that end. As for his foure arguments out of the ſcriptures, which he bringeth in the ſixt booke,<note place="margin"> Cap. 10.</note> the anſwere to them I truſt may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:13152:109"/> of that is already anſwered. Sauing only that the firſt and third require a more ſpecial anſwere. For his ſecond argument in this ſixt booke, is al one with the fourth in the fift booke. And his fourth and laſt in the ſixt, is like the firſt in the fift booke. His firſt argument in the ſixt booke is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken eſpecially of the word <hi>Cooperarii, <hi>Worke men togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with God,</hi>
                        </hi> for ſo the greeke word doth ſignifie, not <hi>Fellow-helpers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 3.</note> as the common latin tranſlation hath, as though God could not without vs worke. Wel let vs ſee his argument. We are workemen togither with God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue freewil, ſay they. But we may more iuſtlie conclude on the contrary, therefore we haue not freewil as the papiſts teach, it ſelfe able to doe good, or auoide euill. For that is it that is in queſtion. We willingly confeſſe, that we being regenerate haue a willingnes to good, and a miſlike of euil, but we ſay that we cannot performe this our good deſire. And therefore ſeeing we cannot worke, but as workemen togither with God, it is moſt euident and plaine, that our will hath not that power that the church of Rome teacheth it to haue, <hi>to be freely moued to good.</hi> And therefore wel ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine, That we will, God worketh without vs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> De gra. &amp; li. arb. t. cap. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>but when we will, and ſo will that we alſo doe, he worketh togither with vs. But without him either working that we may will, or working with vs when we will, we haue no power to the good workes of godlines.</hi> And by this alſo appeareth the anſwere to the other argument which I ſaide was not before anſwered. We are ſaith M. <hi>Bellar.</hi> holpen by God in praier, or in any good worke, therefore we haue free wil. If we remember how they teach, that a man being once holpen and ſtirred vp by Gods grace, is afterwards freely able to doe good, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his wil thus reuiued, or rather vnfettered, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not thinke M. <hi>Bellar.</hi> to be in earneſt in ſuch argumentes. Suppoſe you ſhould vndertake to beare a burden far hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier then you could carry, and another much ſtronger than you, taketh it vp, and beareth it you alſo laying your hands
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13152:109"/> to the ſame, to helpe as you can. Wil you ſay you are able to beare it, becauſe your hand alſo touched it? Euen ſuch is our ability in keeping Gods commaundements. Or as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are firſt taught to goe. Their mother lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them vp that they maie put their legges forwarde, holdeth vp their coates that they be no hinderance to them, yea helpeth them to ſtep forward. There is nothing in the childe, but only that it would faine goe, but it hath not ſtrength to perform it. Is it now any reaſon to ſay, the child is able to goe, becauſe the mother doth thus helpe it. No no, ſeeing Gods helpe is ſuch that he worketh both to wil and to doe in vs, let vs giue glory vnto him only, by whom we may doe al things, and without whom we can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.<note place="margin"> Philip. 2.13. Phil. 4.13. Iohn. 15.5.</note> And we may iuſtly be aſhamed of ſuch fooliſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: God helpeth vs, therefore we haue free will. We may perchance conclude thereupon that we doe ſomewhat, but how little it is that we doe, nay how we doe very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, without Gods good grace in the workes of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in all this Chapter is I hope ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                     <p>But nowe for the concluſion of this Chapter, I woulde gladlie knowe of them that ſo ſtiflie maintaine free will, howe they can cleare themſelues from the Pelagian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſo hated of all the Godly, ſo often condemned by Councels, and ſo mightilie confuted by Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in many of his bookes?<note place="margin"> Orth. explic. lib. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Andradius</hi> anſwereth this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fully.

And yet I ſay they gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted aſmuch as the papiſts doe. Firſt they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that by grace they were holpen that
<pb facs="tcp:13152:110"/> they might become Gods children.<note place="margin"> Aug. ad Bon. li. 1. cap. 3.</note> Yea that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies holpen by Gods grace in euery good worke.

They ſeeme to be birdes of one neſt. What doth <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> (out of whom I haue alleadged this confeſſion of the Pelagians) I ſay, what doth he think of their words? he liketh them wonderful wel. In ſo much, as doubtles, ſaith he, a man would thinke this were ſpoken like a catholicke.<note place="margin"> Ibidem.</note> How then fel it out that ſtil he was accounted an hereticke, and his fauorites? <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> although he could not miſlike much of that he ſaide, yet he could not but condemne their intent and meaning. And therefore when he had ſaid it was ſpoken like a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, he addeth, <hi>If they would not thinke of merit in this their good purpoſe, to which merit reward ſhould bee giuen as of duty, not of grace.</hi> Now I pray you to what end doth the church of Rome defende this doctrine of free wil? Is it not that the doctrine of merits may follow? Yes I warrant you. That is it they ſo earneſtly contend for. For thereby they gaine both credit and coyne. So that they ſeeme then to agree in their words, and in their intent. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore this doctrine of free wil, doth ſo conſpire with the Pelagian hereſie, and ſo diſſent from the word of God as hath beene ſhewed: let vs ſay with ſaint <hi>Auguſtine, Thinking we beleeue, thinking we ſpeake, thinking we doe whatſoeuer we doe:</hi>

Can this then bee any recompence to ſatiſfy God for ſuch times as I haue omitted my duetie? It cannot be, it hath no likelihoode of trueth. Nay, if he worke not (ſaieth <hi>Theophilact</hi>) hee is woorthy of many ſtripes,<note place="margin"> Luc. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>and if he worke, let him content himſelfe, that he is not beaten.

Or, if that worke can but ſerue that duety that then is required, what recompence ſhall wee make for all other our ſinnes. For it is a queſtion amongſt themſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt by his death did take away any ſinnes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly originall ſinne. For <hi>Ambroſe Catharinus</hi> an archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,<note place="margin"> In his booke <hi>de Incruento ſacrif.</hi>
                        </note> and a great man at the Councell of Trent, doeth plainely write, that Chriſt died onely for originall ſinne. As for actuall ſinnes, they muſt be taken away by maſſes and ſuch helps, ſaith he. Now if we had no other hope but ſuch paltry popiſh deuiſes, to take away our ſinnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we continually offend, we were the moſt miſerable of all creatures.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to the wordes of our ſauiour Chriſt. Out of them we may reaſon thus. If our moſt perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience be but duety, it is not merit: but it is but duety: therefore no merit. This whole argument is neceſſarily to be gathered out of the words themſelues, as you ſee the forenamed fathers doe teſtifie. Which place alſo is very ſtrong againſt their moſt blaſphemous doctrine of their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13152:112"/> workes of ſupererrogation. For if all wee can doe,<note place="margin"> Againſt workes of Superer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, <hi>Cap. 20.</hi>
                        </note> bee ſcarce our owne dutie, then can it not ſerue for others, to ſatiſfie for their ſinnes. And yet is this doctrine defended by them, as by <hi>Nichol Burne</hi> in his booke, yea, and by maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who is ſo little aſhamed thereof, that as it were a doctrine that muſt needes be graunted vnto him, he endeuoureth thereby to prooue that we may keepe Gods lawe: A man (ſaieth he) may doe more than God commaundeth:<note place="margin"> De iuſtificat. lib. 4. cap. 13</note> therefore much more may hee fulfill the law.</p>
                     <p>Now if you will knowe the myſtery of this great abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, it is this (as they tel vs.) Whereas ſome men, ſay they, haue beene ſo godly that they haue done mo good workes than they needed, theſe are as it were the treaſure of the church, which the Pope may at his pleaſure beſtow. And ſo he doth: for the pardons and indulgences haue their vertue from theſe workes. So that if there bee no ſuch workes: then the Pope like a falſe merchant hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the world for many yeeres, as ſtill he doeth. For his pardons, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> his <hi>grana benedicta,</hi> and ſuch baggage, haue no vertue, but from their workes of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation. And here I can but wonder, at the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh forehead of the church of Rome in this thing. Shee can in no wiſe abide the imputation of Chriſtes righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for our iuſtification: ſhee may not heare of it. All Popiſh Writers write againſt it. And yet their doctrine of merites, eſpecially of the workes of ſupererrogation, what is it but the imputation of other mens merites, as they think to ſatiſfie for vs, and for our iuſtification. Shal Chriſtes righteouſneſſe imputed to vs, be abſurd to teach? and to teach the imputation of mans workes a ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? We may ſee by this, that in the church of Rome, that doctrine is beſt that is moſt gainefull. For the Pope can gaine but little worldly wealth, by preaching the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſtes righteouſneſſe vnto vs: But by this doctrine of the workes of ſupererrogation hee gaineth
<pb facs="tcp:13152:113"/> much. For becauſe it is the treaſure of the church, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer will haue thereof muſt pay well for it to the church, that is to the pope. But howe doth maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proue, that we can doe more than wee neede. Becauſe that Chriſt bid one that ſaid he had kept all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin"> Mat. 19.22</note> 
                        <hi>Sell all he had, and giue it to the poore.</hi> I will not preſſe maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here with the iudgement of the fathers, who finde this to be a commaundement and therfore not more than neede.<note place="margin"> Confeſſ. li. 13. cap. 19.</note> And ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeeth it to be a law againſt couetouſnes. But who ſo euer will conſider of the place, maie eaſilie ſee, that our ſauiour Chriſt did purpoſe by this commaundement, to let him ſee his owne ignorance of his eſtate, and that he knew not his owne wants. Not meaning that it ſhould be a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, of that he was not by Gods lawe bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, but rather a rule whereby he might trie how far he was from keeping the ſecond table of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therfore that he might euen condemne himſelfe to be much ſhorter, of keeping the firſt table. As for his proofe out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Hom. 8. de poenitentia.</note> 
                        <hi>Manie doe more than they are commanded,</hi> it is true that <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> ſaieth ſo, but it is alſo true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpeaketh of ſuch things, as are not ſimply of themſelues good works, but indifferent of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But the vſe or abuſe of them, doth make them good workes, or euill. His examples that hee bringeth are of virginitie, that it is not commaunded (but this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> omitteth of purpoſe, becauſe it maketh agaynſt their doctrine of vowes:) neither is it commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (ſaieth hee) that men ſhould not poſſeſſe any thing. Yea, I knowe that the Scribes and Phariſees did many things that God neuer commaunded, as alſo the Iewes in the time of <hi>Eſay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Eſa. 1.12.</note> to whom it was ſayde, <hi>Who required theſe things at your handes?</hi> And this is alſo an anſwere to that which out of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> he alledgeth. <hi>What biddeſt thou?</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> De verbis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt. ſer. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>That wee ſhould not bee adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes? Commaundeſt thou that? In louing thee,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13152:113"/> we doe more than thou commaundeſt.</hi> For hee alſo ſpeaketh of keeping virginitie. But maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> antecedent is thus to bee vnderſtoode, that wee doe mo good workes than God commaundeth, or elſe his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to bee denied. For we ſee by experience that the Papiſts doe an infinite number of things that God neuer commaunded. For which as they haue no warrant of God, ſo ſhall they haue no praiſe of him. And they may doe a thouſand ſuch workes, and bee neuer a whit nearer kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Gods lawe, but much further off rather. For the more that men ſatiſfie themſelues with their owne works,<note place="margin"> Mat. 15 &amp; 23</note> the leſſe care they haue to keepe Gods commaundements, as our ſauiour Chriſt teacheth vs. And maiſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> antecedent beeing thus vnderſtoode (as I haue ſaide,) that wee may doe more good workes than God hath commaunded, is falſe. For in that it is not a good worke, if it bee beſides Gods worde, And this is all that hee ſayeth in that place for the woorkes of Supererro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee this rich doctrine hath a poore proofe. But if there were nothing to conuince the wickedneſſe of that doctrine, but this one thing, that they will ſeeme to mende that rule of perfection that God hath made, and take vpon them to preſcribe more perfect rules, than God hath ſet downe, it argueth in them too prophane ſawci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But thus much by the way of this kind of worke. For my purpoſe is not to make of it any ſeueral diſcourſe, becauſe that if it bee prooued, that wee cannot iuſtifie our ſelues by our workes,<note place="margin"> De iuſtif. lib. 5. ca. 5.</note> it will followe that wee can much leſſe helpe others. Nowe maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> finding this weapon too ſharpe, this place to ſtrong agaynſt their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits would faine wreſt it out of our hands. And firſt he telleth vs that ſaint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> willeth vs to knowe what wee are of our ſelues. <hi>Wee muſt knowe the grace, but not bee ignorant of our nature,</hi> ſaieth ſaint <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13152:114"/>
                     <p> It is true, he writeth ſo, and that vpon iuſt occaſion. For the very beginning of that ſentence is, <hi>Peferre not thy ſelf becauſe thou art called a ſonne:</hi> and then followeth: <hi>thou muſt confeſſe the grace, and not forget thy nature.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, thinke no wrong that thou art called an vnprofitable ſeruant, ſeeing thou art called a ſonne. Thou art a ſonne by grace, becauſe God hath choſen thee, but if a man looke on thy worke, it is not woorth prayſing. But what is this to anſwere the argument? Nothing at all. Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> perchance thinketh, that if he bring in the fathers as witneſſes, they will ſpeake as hee woulde haue them. Yet not <hi>Ambroſe</hi> onely, but alſo <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Li. 8. in Luc. de verbis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt. ſer. de humilitate 18. in Oziam</note> in the places by him cited, and <hi>Theophilact</hi> vpon theſe wordes, doe teach, that Chriſt would not haue vs proude of our good workes, that it is our dutie alwayes to worke, and as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaieth, <hi>We owe him our ſeruice, therefore let vs not boaſt of our worke.</hi> But as <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſayth, <hi>If anie thing bee giuen vs, let vs be glad of it, hee that giueth it oweth vs nothing. But the ſeruant oweth to his maſter the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of all that he commandeth.</hi> So all this ſtill ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth my argument, that all that we can do, it is but our duetie, and therefore no merite. And although in reſpect of our election we may iuſtly reioyce that wee are Gods deare children: yet when we looke vpon our ſelues, wee muſt needes confeſſe vs to bee vnprofitable and vnperfect. Secondly, the repugnancie betweene grace and merite, ſet downe by ſaint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Merit and grace ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6</note> is a ſtrong argument againſt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by workes. <hi>If it be of grace, it is no more of workes, or elſe were grace no more grace, or if it bee of workes, it is no more grace, or elſe were worke no more worke.</hi> Wherein we ſee how plainly the Apoſtle oppoſeth the one againſt the other, that we cannot be ſaid to bee iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſtied by grace, if we may attribute anie part of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to workes. Neither will their common anſwer ſerue, that ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the firſt mercie that God
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13152:114"/> ſheweth vs, as that we are called to be Chriſtian men or women, by grace without our workes, but that hereby hee excludeth not the workes that afterwardes we do, from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. For ſeeing our aduerſaries muſt needs confeſſe, that after our firſt calling, yea, and continually ſo long as we liue, we muſt acknowledge, that but by grace wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſaued: this grace which themſelues dare not but confeſſe, taketh away merit: ſo that if grace bee free and without workes in our firſt iuſtification, it can neuer ſtand with workes in the reſt of our life:<note place="margin"> The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of their workes.</note> For ſtill muſt this bee true, if it bee of grace it is not then of workes, if of workes then not of grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the great miſtruſt which I ſee themſelues doe put in this their doctrine of iuſtification by workes, maketh me (who ſee no cauſe to like of it) the more to ſhunne it. For maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> no meane man for learning among them, when hee hath taken much paines to deceyue other with this doctrine,<note place="margin"> Bellar. <hi>a Lutheran,</hi> iuſtif. li. 5. cap. 7.</note> yet himſelfe dareth not truſt it, and therefore ſetteth downe a verie good rule, which if <hi>Caluine</hi> or <hi>Luther</hi> had written it, it muſt needes haue beene called hereticall. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the vncertaintie of our owne righteouſneſſe, and the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of vaine glorie, the ſafeſt way is to put our whole confidence in Gods mercie and goodneſſe.</hi> Vnto which his good and true doctrine, wee ſay Amen, and yet I hope we ſhall not be called heretikes. The ſafeſt way to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that we ſeek: let others paſſe what perillous places it ſhall pleaſe them. Theſe and ſuch other conſiderations doe make me muſe, that euer <hi>men will forſake God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Ierem. 2.13.</note> 
                        <hi>the fountaine of liuing waters, to digge them pits, euen broken pits that can holde no waters,</hi> that they will leaue the plaine and ſafe way, and chooſe the way that hath greateſt daunger, wherein they deale not onely fooliſhly for themſelues, but wickedly alſo with them that they leade into theſe blinde wayes. And I would haue all men to marke this well, that that doctrine, which vpon paine
<pb facs="tcp:13152:115"/> of ſaluation and damnation they teach men muſt beleeue, is daungerous by their owne confeſſion, and the contrarie moſt ſafe. A great argument to teach vs, that they care not ſo much for the ſaluation of mens ſoules, as to get of men profit and credite. And therefore they are the leſſe to be truſted or eſteemed in other poynts in controuerſie, who deale ſo vnchriſtianly in the moſt neceſſarie article of our religion. For you muſt vnderſtande there are two wayes to eternal life, or rather (to ſpeake with the Apoſtle) two kindes of righteouſneſſe. The one ſo hard to hit, that no man or woman, excepting onely Chriſt Ieſus, God and man, could go it, ſo full of ſnares and traps, that none but hee could continue in it. This is that righteouſneſſe of the Lawe,<note place="margin"> Rom. 10.5.</note> which <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth thus. <hi>The man that doeth theſe things ſhall liue thereby.</hi> And this righteouſneſſe did our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeake of, to the expounder of the lawe that came to him to aſke, <hi>What ſhall I doe to inherite eternall life?</hi>

And thus we ſee how Gods iuſtice in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is an vnſpeakeable comforte to our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: aſſuring vs, that God looketh not vpon vs in his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as we are in our ſelues, but as wee are belonging to his ſonne Chriſt. Neither yet doth he weigh the merite of our workes, but how they are made acceptable through Chriſt: who hath merited by his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternal life, for al them that beleeue in him. He looketh not I ſaie what we haue done, but what Chriſt hath done. And it is iuſt he ſhould ſo doe: for he was content to take him to be our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty.

His fift ſort of places are ſuch as promiſe to good workes eternall life. And out of them he reaſoneth thus. Promiſe of rewarde for a worke, doeth make that he that doth the worke, maie bee ſaide to merite
<pb facs="tcp:13152:118"/> his rewarde. That the reward is due but yet not deſerued, I ſhewed before in the anſwere to his firſt argument, and I need not heere to repeat it. His ſixt argument, is taken from thoſe places that ſpeake of our worthines, and are of two ſortes.<note place="margin"> 2. Theſſ. 1.5. Luc. 20.35.</note> For two of them, namely that <hi>That yee maie be counted worthy of the kingdome of God: and that alſo, They ſhalbe counted worthy to inioy that world, and the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> doe anſwere themſelues. For that may be accounted worthy, which of it ſelfe is not ſo in truth. As in our workes is ſeene, which are accounted of, not as they proceed from vs: but as they are preſented before God in the name of Chriſt, and their imperfection couered, with his perfect obedience. The other two places ſeeme more pertinent to his purpoſe, but yet being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnderſtood, prooue nothing for him. The firſt is in the booke of wiſedome, which booke although it is not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, yet becauſe the place alleadged ſeemeth like vnto the words that he alleadgeth out of the reuelation, they may both receiue one anſwere.<note place="margin"> Wiſdom. 3.5 Apocal. 3.4.</note> 
                        <hi>God proueth them, and findeth them worthy for himſelfe.</hi> The other place is, <hi>They ſhall walke with me in white, for they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</hi> Firſt that this worthines doth many times ſignifie an aptnes or fitnes, it cannot be denied. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) can iudge,</hi>

And ſo the Apoſtle willeth vs to walke worthy of God, worthy of our calling, worthy of the goſpell, that is, as becommeth Gods children, them that are called, and fit for the profeſſours of the goſpell. And this fitnes is ſaid to be in vs in reſpect of the new man that is begun within vs, not in reſpect of perfection, that we doe or can attaine vnto. And yet if we ſhould indeed be worthy, we muſt be perfect, which heere we cannot be. And in this ſence you ſee his argument hath no neceſſity. Men are worthy of loue, that is fit to loued, therefore they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13152:118"/> it: for this fitneſſe is not of themſelues. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although we be called worthy, in reſpect of our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt, or in reſpect of the fruits of the ſpirite, which God commendeth in vs, although they haue their wants, that we might not be diſcouraged, but go on forwards in the wayes of godlineſſe, yet this argument will not hold. We are worthy of loue: therefore our workes haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued this loue, or made vs worthy. For our worthineſſe hangeth nothing vpon our works, but that God wil vouch vs to be ſo eſteemed. But in reſpect of our works, we muſt confeſſe with the prophet <hi>Dauid:</hi>

Thirdly, as I haue ſaid in the former chapter, the abſurdities of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that did teach, that God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued man, &amp; wrought in or by him, as a workeman might do in or by a ſtocke or ſtone, they not hauing ſo much as will thereto, made the fathers to ſpeake more, not only of mans freewil, as before I taught, but alſo of the reward of them that worke according to the ſame. And that this did the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moue the fathers to ſpeake ſomwhat too largely vpon this matter, vnleſſe they be warely red, it may be gathered euen by that place that M. <hi>Bella.</hi> out of <hi>Origen</hi> alleadgeth,<note place="margin"> Lib. 2. in Rom. in ca. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let heretikes be excluded, that ſay that the nature of ſoules is good or bad, &amp; let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare that God wil reward them, not according to their nature, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits.</hi> Now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of theſe words,<note place="margin"> Rom, 2.</note> I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the anſwere vnto his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d argument. But heere it appeareth that ſuch heretikes did then trouble the church. Laſt of al, not al the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the fathers, are to be taken or vnderſtoode as they ſound: but they muſt be warely red, and wiſely examined by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13152:119"/> the touchſtone of Gods word. And then it will appeare, that the Fathers, either may well bee taken, or iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
                     <p>And thus hauing (I truſt) in the iudgement of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader, ſufficiently confirmed the trueth, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Scriptures alleadged to the contrary, and ſhewed ſome cauſes, why the fathers ſhould in this point be read with good aduiſe and iudgement: it now onely remaineth that I lay open the abſurditie of that ſhift, wherein they truſt much, and which indeede is the chiefe ſtrength of their cauſe. For being preſſed with the teſtimonies out of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſpecially out of ſaint <hi>Paul,</hi> which plainely teſtifie that we are <hi>iuſtified by faith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Rom. 3.28</note> 
                        <hi>without the workes of the law:</hi> firſt, they deuiſed this anſwere, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the ceremoniall laws, that we are iuſtified without them, but not without doing the works of the law morall, or of the commaundements. But this being ſo vntrue an anſwere, that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe is aſhamed of it,<note place="margin"> De iuſtificat. lib. 1. cap. 19.</note> and reaſoneth againſt it: Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other anſwere, namely, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the workes before faith. So that he would haue the wordes of the Apoſtle thus to ſound: Wee are iuſtified by faith without the works of the law that were done before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. And for the credit of this interpretation he would faine father it vpon <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>S. Ierome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> De gr. &amp; lib. arb. ca. 7. de praedeſt. ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. cap. 7.

Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>S. Ierome</hi> in thoſe places doe not ſo expound thoſe wordes of ſaint <hi>Paul,</hi> neither giue vs anie rule ſo to expound them. Neither yet doe <hi>Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Theophilact,</hi> or <hi>Primaſius</hi> vpon thoſe words either in the third to the Romans, or ſecond to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians ſo expound it:<note place="margin"> Rom. 4.4.</note> Or yet <hi>S.

And in the Epiſtle that he writeth againſt the Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> he denieth that thoſe words may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the law ceremoniall: but concerning this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth there is no word.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13152:120"/>
                     <p> As for the reaſon that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to prooue this his expoſition: let vs conſider of it. <hi>Vnto him that worketh</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Paul) the wages is not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fauour, but by debt.</hi> Therefore (ſaith M. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>) he ſpeaketh onely of thoſe workes that are done by the power of free will without grace. How little <hi>S. Paule</hi> dreamed of free will, hath in the former chapter beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And that hee doeth not in theſe wordes expound, what he meant before by the workes of the lawe, the text it ſelfe prooueth. For, hauing ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued God, and that was counted to him for righteouſnes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Apoſtle inferreth: that if he had beene iuſtified by workes, his iuſtification had bin of debt, not of grace. So that he doth not heere expound his former wordes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in this fourth chapter an other argument, by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being already iuſtified and a holie man, to prooue iuſtification by faith without workes, euen by forgiueneſſe of ſinnes or couering them. And as I haue ſhewed maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> interpretation to ſtand vppon no good ground, but that the place aledged maketh againſt himſelfe: ſo that which we gather out of <hi>S. Paules</hi> words to be the moſt true meaning, namely, that workes neither before nor after our firſt iuſtification (as they call it) can merit, the circumſtances of the place do proue, &amp; the whole courſe of his doctrine. He inſtructeth the Rom. &amp; Galath. in this doctrine, who were already become chriſtians, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready were iuſtified. He doth not only ſhew that the works of the law do not iuſtifie, but telleth vs, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of the law is to make vs to know ſin,<note place="margin"> Rom. 7.7. Rom. 4.15.</note> &amp; <hi>to cauſe wrath,</hi> euen after we be iuſtified. And <hi>S.

                        <note place="margin"> Philip. 3.8, 9</note>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13152:120"/> were written almoſt thirty yeeres after his conuerſion, ſtill relieth vpon the righteouſneſſe that is by faith: and he calleth it Gods righteouſneſſe, and refuſeth that which commeth by workes, and that he calleth mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now of this which is ſaid, I truſt I may thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from iuſtification, not only the works that are done before we beleeue, but alſo the works which we afterwards doe: therefore maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> interpretation is not true.

Some expounde this place of the angels, but ſo as they make <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to aſke this queſtion (to whom amongſt the angels <hi>Iob</hi> wil turne) ſcoffingly. As if he had ſaid, if thou ſhouldſt aſke of them it were in vaine, they would not anſwer thee. But howſoeuer it is, it is certaine, that heere is no mention of inuocation or praier vnto the angels,<note place="margin"> Philippus Presbiter in Iob.</note> but rather as it ſeemeth by <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus Presbiter</hi> vpon this place, a taunting reproofe of <hi>Iob,</hi> if he beleeued not <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his words.

And why not rather in reſpect of Gods promiſe, which we know hee is able and ready to performe, then of their merits.<note place="margin"> Theod. queſt 67. in Exod.</note> So that if there were any inuocation or praier to them, as there is not (it is onlie a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that God will remember them) and therefore this place belongeth not to the matter now in queſtion, but if there were any praier vnto them, we ſee that it cannot bee concluded out of this place that <hi>Moſes</hi> would haue God to regarde their merites. But maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will helpe the matter with a teſtimonie out of the Pſalmes. <hi>Lord remember Dauid and al his kindnes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Pſal. 131.2.</note> There ſaith maiſter <hi>Bellarmine, Salomon</hi> praieth in reſpect of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dauids</hi> merits: but the word vpon which his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument dependeth, that heere is tranſlated kindnes, may be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated <hi>Affliction.</hi> And <hi>S.

But I haſten to that argument, that coulde neuer yet be anſwered, for ſo maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith. And it is this. We may deſire them that are aliue to pray for vs, therefore we maie pray to the ſaints that are departed. If maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had not liked ſo well of this argument, I ſhould not haue thought it worth any anſwere. For to praie one for another whileſt we are aliue, is both warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and commaunded of God: but to praie to them that are gone, wee haue neither commaundement nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. And there is greate difference betweene praiers, which the papiſts woulde make to them that are dead, and ſuch requeſtes as the godlie haue made, or we may make to them that are aliue to praie for vs. But maiſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> will ſtrengthen his argument, by remoouing the cauſes that maie hinder this inuocation, or rather their interceſſion for vs. Firſt if wee ſaie they will not praie for vs: hee anſwereth, they haue greater loue than
<pb facs="tcp:13152:126"/> they had, and therefore they will. But what manner of loue they haue to vs ward, is not deſcribed in the Scriptures: And therefore we cannot of that their loue which is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, gather any certaine argument. But ſure I am, their loue towards God and our ſauiour Chriſt is ſo great, that they will not rob either God of his glory, or Chriſt of his office of mediation. And they cannot pray for vs becauſe, as before I haue ſhewed euen out of maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that they want faith. And whether they know that we pray or not, it is vncertaine. As for the wrong that is done vnto God, if any but he be praied vnto, which maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> imagineth to be the fourth let why they cannot pray for vs: he anſwereth that if that be any hinderance to Gods glory,<note place="margin"> Coloſſ. 2.23.</note> it alſo is againſt Gods glory, that they who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, ſhould requeſt other to pray for them. Which his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere how fooliſh it is, the very wemen and children maie eaſily perceiue, how the one hath commandement, the other muſt goe amongſt the wil-worſhippings: eſpecially if wee conſider the practiſe of inuocation in the popiſh church. For although now to make ſome faire ſhewe of their doctrine, they will teach vs,<note place="margin"> De beatitud. ſanct. li. 1. ca. 17.</note> that the ſaints <hi>Are not the immediate interceſſours vnto God for vs, but obtaine our requeſtes of God through Chriſt,</hi> as maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth: yet it cannot be denied, that men and women haue had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the ſaint it ſelfe, haue vowed, and performed their vowes vnto the ſame for their deliuerance, haue praied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame for helpe.<note place="margin"> Act. &amp; Mon. pag. 1117. 1443.</note> And theſe men haue not beene repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, no they were thought to haue a good deuotion, and to merit thereby: but ſome haue beene accuſed of hereſie for not praying in their trauell to the virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Yea they haue publiſhed a blaſphemous thing, called the Pſalter of the Virgin, compiled by <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> in which whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the Pſalmes and ſome other ſcripture is ſpoken of the Lord, is moſt wickedly by them applied vnto the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom they call lady. Yea to be ſhort, it is almoſt as full of blaſphemies as of words. An infinite number of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13152:126"/> their owne prayers, might bee brought againſt them out of their owne bookes to teſtifie againſt themſelues, of that ſuperſtitious confidence which they haue had in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and yet would they now perſwade the world, that they neuer meant they ſhould make interceſſion to God for vs, but by Chriſt: but in trueth they made them rather gods than mediators. As when the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to command her Sonne, and to ſhew her to be his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Or when vnto her they pray thus: <hi>In al our trouble and diſtreſſe help vs, moſt holy virgin Mary.</hi> And thus haue I thought good, briefly to examine their proofes out of the ſcripture, and to take away that ſhew of reaſons, that they made out of Gods word.

Is this a doctrine to be receiued now as catholike, that hath ſo long beene buried in ſilence, and will not yet perchance be very well liked of.

                     <p>This good ſeede of Inuocating and calling vppon God, continued about ſome two hundred yeares in the church vntill that enuious man at the laſt, whileſt Gods ſeruants were aſleepe, did ſowe that euill ſeede of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the creatures. And although ſome did like well of it, yet was it miſliked alſo by ſome of the godly, as moſt notably appeareth in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> againſt the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes called <hi>Collyridiani,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Haereſ. 79</note> who offered a bunne or cake to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or for her ſake: and of that they had their name. And ſo the Papiſts do offer their waxe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, yea many times very pretious thinges vnto their ſaints. But <hi>Epiphanius</hi> compareth ſuch to a common harlot, that runne a whooring from one onely God: and ſaieth this olde errour ſhall not preuaile, to leaue him that liueth, and to worſhip the creature. He will not haue her worſhipped, neither yet that they ſhould offer in her name. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeuouring to anſwere this place,<note place="margin"> De beatitud. ſanct li. 1. ca. 15</note> ſaith that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reprooueth that hereſie, becauſe they woulde make a god of her. But the place is maruellous ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Popiſh ceremonies, in their ſuperſtitious ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> gathereth of this that they did to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that they made her a god, not that they eſteemed or called her a god (for they neuer denied the one God) but that they did to her that which the Gentiles doe to their gods. And (I pray you) did they any more to the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> than our Papiſtes doe? Let it be examined. They offered bunnes or takes in her name: the Papiſts do offer ſundrie ſorts of things: and, the more, and the coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, the Prieſts thinke the better of it. At a certaine day in the yeere ſome women vſed to trimme ſome Waggon, and couer it ouer with a ſheete, and for certaine dayes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13152:128"/> woulde ſet there ſome breade, and offer it in her name, being aſſembled together: The Papiſts make many as pretie ſhewes as this could be: for, the worſhip of their Saints haue their dayes ſet downe for it. The women alſo doe with thoſe heretikes, celebrate thoſe holie my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Howe many religious orders the Popiſh church hath to celebrate the myſteries in honour of their Lady, as they doe terme her, let the worlde iudge. But our Papiſts being compared with thoſe heretikes, goe as neere (I warrant you) to make their ſaints gods, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did the Collyridians to make a God of the Virgine <hi>Mary.</hi> And howe doeth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> confute this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? <hi>What Scripture</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath taught vs this? which of the Prophets commaunded a man, much leſſe a woman to bee adored?</hi> If then the Scriptures muſt teach vs, and the Prophets muſt direct vs in our religion: becauſe this inuocation of the creature hath no warrant in the worde, wee may ſafely reiect it. And that our prayers, whether they bee priuate or publike,<note place="margin"> 
                           <hi>Prayers muſt be in a tongue that wee know.</hi> Orat. in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litt. In Geneſ. hom. 29. De Orthod. fide li. 3. c. 24</note> muſt bee in a tongue that wee vnderſtand, it is by many reaſons to be prooued. For if that prayer bee as Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> defineth it, <hi>A requeſting of ſome good thing of God, powred out to God of the godlie:</hi> or as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> ſaieth, <hi>It is a talke with God:</hi> or as <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> doeth write, <hi>The aſcending of the minde vnto God,</hi> or, <hi>the crauing of thinges fit to be asked of God:</hi> then is it moſt neceſſary, that whether we pray in publike, or priuatly, we ſhould vnderſtand what we ſay, leſt in ſteed of good wee aſke that which is euill, and our talke ſhoulde not be ſeemely or agreeable to the maieſtie of God, with whom wee talke: neither can our minde aſcend in prayer, if the vnderſtanding of our words be not as it were a wing to helpe it vp. Therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> exhorteth vnto ſobrietie, eſpecially when we ſhould pray, and woulde haue vs in prayer to gather together the powers of our minde,<note place="margin"> In Geneſ. hom. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>That our minde may accompany our wordes to God,
<pb facs="tcp:13152:129"/> for feare leaſt our prayer turne to our condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And moſt plaine is that that the Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>If I pray in a ſtrange tongue,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 14 14</note> 
                        <hi>my ſpirit praieth, but mine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is without fruit.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 14.26</note> Thus then I reaſon: <hi>All thinges ought to be doone to edifying, But the praiers that are made in a ſtrange tongue that the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not, are not done to edifying,</hi> therfore they are not ſuch as they ought to be. This whole argument is ſaint <hi>Paules.</hi> For the firſt propoſition is his very wordes. The ſecond is neceſſarie to be gathered out of his words. For if ſuch praiers are without fruit, as the apoſtle ſaith they are,<note place="margin"> Regal. bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiores quaeſt. 278.</note> then they doe not edifye. <hi>For when</hi> (ſaieth <hi>Baſil) the words of the praier are vnknowen to them that are preſent, then the minde of him that praieth is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe without fruit, becauſe none is the better for it.</hi> For as the ſame father in his anſwer to the next queſtion ſaieth of the vnderſtanding of ſcripture,<note place="margin"> Quaeſt. 278.</note> ſo may we ſay of praier. he compareth the vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures vnto the taſte of our meate. And ſaieth that men heare profitably, when the vnderſtanding of the word is vnto their minde, as the taſte of the meate is vnto the body. And ſo may we likewiſe ſay, that then we praie with fruit, when in our minde we vnderſtand what we praie for, as well as our mouth taſteth our meat what it is that we eat. Which place of ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> troubleth maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſo, that after that he hath ſeen and vewed many anſwers ſcarce anie can pleaſe him.<note place="margin"> De verbo dei lib. 2. cap. 16</note> But at the length hee reſolueth vpon this, that the apoſtle ſpeaketh not of their common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but of ſuch ſpirituall ſongs as themſelues made. But that anſwere will not ſerue the turne. For hee that commaunded that all things that are done in ſuch mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſhould bee done to edifying, would not onelie that ſuch ſpirituall ſongs ſhould bee vnderſtood, but alſo all other their prayers and exerciſes. And therefore <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> thinketh that they who come not to edifie others,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13152:129"/> may as well be away. And that this edifying ſhould,<note place="margin"> Hom. 36. in 1. Cor.</note> if not onely, yet eſpecially be regarded, <hi>Let nothing</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Primaſius) bee in you,</hi>

                        <hi>wherewith you do not edifie one another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if edifying bee eſpecially to bee regarded in our Chriſtian aſſemblies, then they that edifie the greateſt number, doe eyther winne or confirme moſt in the fayth, and ſo doe beſt ſeruice to God. And therefore I can not but maruaile at maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that hee is ſo willing to defende the verie dregges of poperie, that hee will rather ſpeake agaynſt all ſence, then hee will ſeeme to ſay nothing. Who would once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that which hee often affirmeth,<note place="margin"> De verbo dei lib. 2. cap. 16.</note> that all the people neede not vnderſtande the prayers? What then doe they in the aſſemblie, if they vnderſtande not what is ſayde? All had woont to ſay Amen, as maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> noteth out of <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> 1. Cor. 14.16</note> But ſaint <hi>Paule</hi> thinketh it abſurde that they ſhoulde ſay Amen to that they vnderſtande not, therefore all people ſhoulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande.</p>
                     <p>But yet more fooliſh is that hee ſayeth, that the people needeth not vnderſtande the prayers, becauſe they are made not to the people, but to God, and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that God vnderſtande them. What, is maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in earneſt, or but in ieaſt? is hee waking, or but in a dreame? The prayers are made to God, it is true, they ſhould bee ſo. But the Popiſh Church will haue vs alſo to pray in Latine to the Saints, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of which when they were aliue, vnderſtoode no La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, whatſoeuer they nowe doe.

                     <p>But maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will confeſſe, that in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers, euery member of the Church ſhould haue his ſhare, which he cannot haue vnleſſe his heart ioyne in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the words of the miniſter.

<pb facs="tcp:13152:130"/> enough, vnleſſe we alſo know what we ſue for vnto God. For it is not in this caſe as it is with worldly princes, as maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> moſt prophanely ſurmiſeth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee for whome another maketh ſuite vnto the prince, needeth not to care whether he vnderſtand or not the wordes that hee that maketh requeſt for him doeth ſpeake: yet if hee make requeſt for himſelfe, it is verie needfull hee ſhould well vnderſtande his owne wordes. Nowe the prayers of the Church, although they bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by one man to auoyde confuſion, yet they are not the prayers of one, but of the whole Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould the whole Church ſay Amen vnto them.

And this is one part of the communion of Saints, that wee ioyne together in one to prayſe God, or pray vnto him, as one bodie, though manie members, yea, as one minde in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie bodies. And this they did when <hi>The Chriſtians loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp to heauen,</hi>

                        <note place="margin"> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of praiers.</note>Nowe for the numbring of their prayers vpon their beades, or otherwiſe, I doubt whether it can haue anie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of excuſe. For why doe they ſcore them vp? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wil go nothing beyond the number of praiers? or that they may bee ſure to pay God all they owe him? To thinke they can giue him all his due, is too great wickedneſſe. And ſo to ſtint themſelues in their praiers,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13152:130"/> howſoeuer they finde themſelues affected to pray, doeth plainely ſhewe that they knowe not what it is to pray. For if it bee the crie (as one ſayeth) of the heart, and not of the mouth: then is it time to make an ende of praying, when eyther our heart is ſatiſfied, in hauing the requeſt that it made, graunted, or elſe it waxe faint, and fall downe as <hi>Moſes</hi> his handes did,<note place="margin"> Exod. 17.</note> that it cannot lift vp it ſelfe to God.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing men cannot bee alwayes alike minded in prayer, it is but follie to appoint themſelues, alwayes the like meaſure of prayers. And ſuch prayers are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times turned into prating and vaine babling. Or doe they number <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> eir prayers, that they may ſay to God: Thou art indebted vnto vs for ſo many prayers? It may ſo bee: For ſuch is the fooliſh imagination of man, when hee once refuſeth to bee directed by Gods worde, that there is nothing ſo abſurde, no toy ſo childiſh, but they will account it to be a religious ſeruing of God. And ſo in this, by a little lippe labour, they ſeeke to buy thoſe paltrie pardons, of ſuch preſumptuous Popes, as wil take vpon them by making a gaine of mens ſins, to tread vnder foote the moſt precious bloud of Chriſt. But what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo rich a raunſome, as Chriſt his bloud, if ſo vile a price may ſerue the turne? If I would I might bring manie examples of ſuch pardons, for ſaying a certaine number of prayers. But it is a filthie ſinke, that I loue not to rake in</p>
                     <p>The ground of this blaſphemous doctrine, is the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie of all other blaſphemies, the ſumme whereof was vttered at Trent, in the time of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, by <hi>Paulus Guidellus,</hi> in the hearing of manie of the fathers. <hi>That the Apoſtles and their ſchollers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Popiſh blaſphemy</note> 
                        <hi>did lay the foundation of Chriſtian religion, vppon their owne bloud and merits, as vpon a moſt ſure rocke, and thereby it came to paſſe that Chriſts kingdome was enlarged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13152:131"/>
                     <p> What greater iniurie could they doe to the bloud of Chriſt? But this perſwaſion being once entred, that the bloud of the Saints is ſo auaileable, they will hope well, if they can mumble vp a number of prayers to pleaſe them, that they ſhall haue pardon of their ſinnes for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeares. If the Papiſts bee aſhamed of this doctrine, as iuſtly they may, let them ſhewe it condemned in that their Councell. If they allowe of it, they are aſhame to the name of Chriſtianitie. But, that prayers cannot bee meritorious, it followeth of that which before I haue ſaid in the fiue and twentie Chapter. For if no workes can merit, then not prayer.</p>
                     <p>The laſt abuſe in prayer, is, that as it is many times nothing zealous, or earneſt, ſo it is not of faith, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all aſſured perſwaſion of Gods goodneſſe, or readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to heare vs. Yea, many times men ſpeake the words of prayer, neither conſidering what they aſke, or howe greatly they ſtande in neede to be heard, or to whom they ſpeake, or with what boldneſſe they may come vnto him, in reſpect of his abundant mercies. But becauſe this is rather the fault of the men than of the doctrine, I will not meddle with it. But yet I cannot but maruell at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

                     <p>And if in anie article of their religion, then ſure in this, in my iudgement, they haue a moſt miſerable defence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they cannot commend their Images as thinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them of God, or vſed of the Godly. They can only plead not guilty. Our Images are not Idols. We worſhip them not with any vnlawful worſhip. And ſo all that they can doe, is to excuſe themſelues from being Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. No it is more then they can doe, conſidering howe God hath forbidden them, and good men haue deteſted them. Are they not careleſſe thinke you of their owne, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſaluation, that will commend that to the people as good and neceſſary, whereof when they haue ſpoken the beſt they can, they cannot truely ſaie it is not euill? But let vs ſee by what arguments they will proue that images are
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13152:132"/> not euil, images I ſaie that haue anie worſhip done vnto them. For ſuch images as are not in danger to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, we ſpeake not againſt. Firſt they put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene an Idol and an image, &amp; ſaie that an Idol is a falſe likenes of a thing, an image doth truely repreſent thinges vnto vs.<note place="margin"> Bellar. lib 2. de Imag. c. 5.</note> Firſt in matter or ſubſtance they will confeſſe that there is no difference betweene them. For both are made of gold, ſiluer, wood, ſtone or ſuch like. Secondly, in forme they agree, for they are like ſome man or woman. Thirdly, they are of like might or power either againſt miſe or rats, or duſt and cobwebs, and alike able they are or rather vnable to helpe themſelues, or others. Fourthly, the vſe of the Idols that the gentiles had,<note place="margin"> De preparat. Euang. lib. 3.</note> and that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts haue is all one. For <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſheweth that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did vſe their Idols as bookes, to learne by them God himſelfe and his power,<note place="margin"> Contra gent. lib. 1.</note> and to expreſſe and ſet forth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible things of God, by their images? And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> a little before him affirmeth the ſame. For he reporteth that ſuch as were the wiſer ſorte of them ſaid, they were as bookes or letters, wherein they might read and learne to know God. And are they not vſed in the popiſh church to be laie mens bookes? Let themſelues ſpeake. We deſire in this cauſe no other witneſſes. Why then ſaith <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> in the place before alleadged, what is there in the image that doth repreſent God? Is it the matter? What neede was there then that a ſhape ſhould be giuen vnto it? Or what need we ſeeke that in few places that is in many? For ſtone, wood, gold and ſuch like maie eaſlier els where be found then in churches. Is it the forme, the likeneſſe of men or other creatures? Why then ſhoulde it not bee thought that men themſelues, or other creatures, ſhoulde more liuelie repreſent God than their image? Is it the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or workemanſhip? Then men that deuiſed this ſkill maie rather teach vs, than the image which they made. Thus we ſee how this ancient writer doth confute ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, not only the opinion that Pagans had of the vſe of their
<pb facs="tcp:13152:133"/> Idols, but alſo that popiſh vſe of images to be laie mens bookes. And ſeeing in al theſe points they are ſo like, as if they were twinnes of one birth, why ſhould we doubt but they are al one. But they are not more like in anie thing, than in that definition of an idol which maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe hath ſet downe.<note place="margin"> De Imag. li. 2 cap. 5. <hi>The image of God the father.</hi> De Imag. li. 2 cap. 8.</note>

If this be no fault in him, I truſt the indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will not thinke it to be a fault in vs. Well then images and idols agreeing ſo wel as they doe, in matter, forme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilitie, vſe, definition, and name, why maie they not bee birdes of one neſt? and whelpes of one litter, one of them taken for the other?

                        <hi>they muſt be carried and ſet in their place. So do they ſtand and can not remoue from their place. Though a man crie vnto them, yet can they not anſwere, nor deliuer him out of his tribulation.</hi> If this be not true of their images alſo, then wee will confeſſe they are no idoles. And this is a thing well woorthy to bee noted,<note place="margin"> Bellarm. de imag lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> that whereas the vſuall names that the ſcriptures giue idoles are theſe, as maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Elilim, <hi>falſe,</hi>

For popiſh images had no commaundement, but the images in the temple of Ieruſalem had. Againe, the images that were in the temple were not praied vnto, or any way wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, as were popiſh images. Yea, and if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wil beleeue <hi>Ioſephus</hi> a Iew, writing of their ſtory, he ſhal find that the Iewes were very ſcrupulous and preciſe in that point,<note place="margin"> Ioſep. anti. cap. 11.

And that is the cauſe that wee ſeeke not by publike faſtings and prayer to make a publike conuerſion vnto God, agaynſt whome ſo publikely wee haue ſinned. God moue the hearts of them that are in authoritie, to rowſe vp themſelues at the length, to thinke better of their duetie in this poynt, and of our common ſaftie.

Why then, we confeſſe that faſting is good and commendable, it is a moſt

<pb facs="tcp:13152:139"/> onely of faſting, as though that onely had turned away Gods wrath, and yet wee ſee by the ſtorie, they made leaſt account of it, but eſpecially of praying. Neither is this a good argument: They did faſt and God deliuered them: therefore their faſting merited this their deliueraunce. His ſeconde proofe is out of the example of <hi>Achab,</hi> who may in deede bee a good patterne of popiſh meriting,<note place="margin"> 1. Kin. 22.27 29</note> for he continued wicked ſtill. But hee is in this, much like as faithfull as the other: For <hi>Ahab</hi> rent his cloathes, and put on ſackcloath, faſted and lay in ſackecloath, and went ſoftly as men vſe to doe in heauineſſe. So manie tokens of ſorrowe or feare did <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhewe, and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could ſee nothing in him but faſting.

In deed in his fourth example which is the ſtorie of <hi>Heſter</hi> there is no mention in the place cited by him,<note place="margin"> Heſter. 4.16</note> of anie thing that was done, but <hi>Heſter</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a faſt. But ſhall we imagine that they did not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe humble themſelues but onely by faſting, nor ſeeke to intreate God by prayer, as though this faſting could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that they deſired?

<pb facs="tcp:13152:140"/> appointed their lent faſt, their wedneſdaie and fryday faſt, ſaterday faſt, embar faſt, the faſts of aduent and cogation weeke. But that theſe cannot be accounted times of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to be kept and obſerued for faſting in reſpect of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obſeruation of the ſame, it cannot better be proued, than by that diuerſitie of opinions and iudgement, which M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe is forced to confeſſe to be in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers.<note place="margin"> De bonis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus in part. li. 2.</note> As they ſhall vnderſtand that reade of the book before alleadged the fifteeneth, the ſeuenteenth, eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and nineteenth chapters. As for their faſtes vppon ſaintes eues, they come after al the reſt. Seeing therefore there is herein ſuch diuerſitie, it is plaine enough, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any certainty of doctrine can heere be gathered, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they cal it a catholicke religion, that is like <hi>Iacobs</hi> coate of many colours, farre from vnity of faith. But with ſaint <hi>Hillary</hi> I maie ſay,<note place="margin"> In pſ. 118. A</note> 
                        <hi>It is moſt hard for a man by the doctours of this world, to vnderſtande the meaning of heauenly precepts.</hi> And this I could wiſh, that at al times we would ſtriue, by this and other good meanes, to tame our rebellious fleſh: and that we alſo would prepare our ſelues vnto the holy exerciſes of our religion, either by this or anie other way that maie further therein: but that faſting it ſelfe doth make vs acceptable to God, wee muſt not thinke. And out of this their opinion of the merit of faſting, ariſeth another moſt abſurd doctrine of binding the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their lawes of faſting,<note place="margin"> Their lawes of faſting bind not the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Li.</hi> 2. <hi>de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis operibus in part. ca.</hi> 7. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.6.</note> as the church of Rome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth with one conſent, as M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth.

The Rechabites obeied the politicke lawe that their father <hi>Ionadab</hi> gaue them: therefore the church may binde mens conſciences with the law of faſting. It is one thing to bind the conſcience, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to require external obedience. The faſt and holie daie which is commaunded to be continued in the ſtorie of <hi>Heſter</hi> is like vnto it,<note place="margin"> Heſter. 9.31.</note> for a day of remembraunce of Gods
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13152:140"/> great benefit towardes them, but not to binde the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Such alſo is the faſt mentioned in <hi>Zachary,</hi> of the fourth, fifth, ſeuenth and tenth monethes, which although it might perchance vppon good and godlie conſideration be taken vp, and we debarre none, but exhort all perſons to humble themſelues vnto the Lord: yet how little their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is bound thereto, it partly appeareth, becauſe God faith in the former Chapter that they did not faſt vnto him, and willeth them to harken vnto the miniſterie of prophets, and <hi>to execute true iudgement, and ſhewe mercy and compaſsion euery man to his brother,</hi> &amp; not to oppreſſe: for theſe are in deede good workes that God regardeth, in compariſon of which hee little eſteemeth thoſe their faſtes. Partlie alſo becauſe God wil turne their faſting into fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, <hi>into ioy and gladnes and proſperous high feaſtes,</hi> as there he ſaith.<note place="margin"> Act. 15.29.</note> And laſtly he bringeth that law that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſet downe, of not eating the bloud and things ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. A law I ſaie, made by the direction of Gods ſpirite, as there is witneſſed for a lawe: whereof they can finde no ſuch praiſe. A law that was made according to the neceſſity of that time, to auoide diuiſion, and for the better vniting and gathering of the church of the Iewes and gentiles, as M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, and therefore ſuch a law, as lawfully might be made. For in thinges indifferent, the church maie take order for the quietnes or anie other waie for the benefit of the fame. Whereby they would eſtabliſh a law for euer to binde the conſcience. A law I ſay, which themſelues wil confeſſe we are not bound vnto, but doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that law that the apoſtles made. But how could we breake that law if it bound the conſcience? Or if it doe not binde the conſcience, why doth M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bring it to proue that the church may tie or bind the conſciences of the faithfull, vnto their lawes of faſting?</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee that not one of all the places alleadged by him out of the ſcripture, doth prooue the neceſſity of theſe lawes of faſting, which ſo ſtraitly they command. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:13152:141"/> by the weakenes of their proofe, we may ſee the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their doctrine.<note place="margin"> Difference of meates.</note> Now I come vnto the laſt point of their doctrine which we miſlike, which is the difference of meats that they make. Wherein if they doe not conſpire with the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and ſundry other hereticks that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne fleſh as a thing vnpure: yet it ſeemeth that they haue bin brought vp in the ſchoole of the heretickes called <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolici,</hi>

But our aduerſaries tel vs, that the <hi>Ebionites, Tatianites, Maniches, Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and ſuch other heretickes, doe vtterly condemne fleſh, as vncleane or vnlawful, to be eaten at any time: But them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thinke it only at certaine times vnlawful. Admit it be ſo. If they wil not goe in the rancke with the old here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, let it then be an hereſie, deuiſed (in ſuch ſort as now it is) by popiſh heretickes.<note place="margin"> De violandis virginibus.</note> For if hereſie be, <hi>Whatſoeuer ſauoureth againſt the truth, although it be euen an olde cuſtome,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> very wel defineth it, then doubtles this popiſh forbidding of certaine meats for conſcience ſake, wil be found hereſie. For the truth ſaith, that they who <hi>commaunde to abſtaine from meates which God hath created to bee receiued with giuing of thankes,</hi>

But the church of Rome teacheth, that this is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine, a ſounde religion. And they that teach it are good catholickes. The church of Rome then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth againſt the truth, as in manie other articles ſo in this alſo, and therefore it is hereticall.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13152:141"/> that for theſe reaſons. Firſt the circumſtance of the time moueth me to it.<note place="margin"> 1.

And <hi>Ebion</hi> that was the firſt, as I remember, that deuiſed that hereſie, liued in the daies of the apoſtle, and did ſow his ſeede of that heretical doctrine, verie ſoone after the apoſtles death.

The apoſtle therefore had reſpect chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to more dangerous heretickes than they were, that could carry the matter more cunninglie than wholy to condemne the creature. His wordes alſo are verie plaine if wee marke them well. For he doth not ſaie that they ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne or diſpraiſe meates, which God hath made, which was the hereſie of thoſe olde heretickes: But, they ſhall commaunde others to abſtaine from them, to refuſe them, not to receiue them: and this is flat the hereſie of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. And the apoſtle confuting this hereſie, doeth not commend the goodneſſe or pureneſſe of the creature, as it had beene needefull for him to haue done, if hee had chieflie ment his wordes againſt them: but hee ſheweth the lawful vſe of the creature, that it is to bee receiued, and it is not to be refuſed. Which eſpecially armeth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romiſh infection, for to ſpeake as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doeth vppon theſe wordes,<note place="margin"> Ambroſe vpon theſe words.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the apoſtle ſeemeth to haue regard vnto ſuch as ſhoulde teach the doctrine vnto that ende, that ſome in his daies did among the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> to put ſome religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:13152:142"/> in theſe outward and bodily exerciſes, exhorting them thus: <hi>Touch not, taſt not, handle not, which all periſh with the vſing,</hi>

                        <hi>For the kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, but righteouſnes, and peace, and ioie in the holy ghoſt.</hi> Now I cannot but maruel, ſeeing the apoſtle willeth vs to abſtaine <hi>from all appearance of euil,</hi> what is the reaſon that our aduerſaries wil come ſo neere thoſe heretical opinions, which are ſo condemned by the godly of al ages,<note place="margin"> Iohn. 4.24.</note> and doe not rather ſeeke to worſhip in ſpirite and truth as our ſauiour Chriſt telleth vs we muſt doe, than to put any holineſſe in theſe external obſeruances, which wee ſee ſo many heretickes haue delighted in. I would therefore exhort our aduerſaries to be more wiſe in that point: for they get them an euil name, by hauing ſo great a ſmacke of ſuch corrupt opinions, and haue had lucke in the choice of their obſeruances, wherein they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding repoſe a great piece of holines. For thoſe two things wherein they ſuppoſe they commend themſelues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much vnto the world, which is forbidding of marriage to ſome ſort of men, and meates at ſome times to al, and at al times to ſome men, doe moſt euidently bewray their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious religion. Wherein they are not only noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the apoſtle, and pointed at to be had teachers, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo almoſt al thoſe heretickes that condemned fleſh as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, were alſo enemies to marriage, as in part at the leaſt the papiſts are. And thus whileſt they will ſeeme more holy then others, in not vſing holily and with thankes giuing;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13152:142"/> Gods good ordinance and creatures: they come ſo neare thoſe prophane and wicked heretikes that haue gone before them, that al good men take them to be a branch out of that roote, and water of the ſame ſpring.<note place="margin"> Bellar. de bonis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus in part. li. 2. cap. 5.</note> But what arguments haue they to iuſtifie this their doctrine? Maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> can affoorde vs but one, that maketh any ſhewe of proofe, that fleſh is more vnlawfull to be eaten than other meates, and that but a ſimple one.<note place="margin"> Dan. 10.3.</note> It is out of <hi>Daniel</hi> where he ſaieth, <hi>I haue not eaten any pleaſant bread, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came fleſh nor wine in my mouth.</hi> Maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> arguments are like to fruit that ſheweth faire at the firſt, but is rotten at the heart. For, what can hee prooue out of this? <hi>Daniel</hi> abſtained from fleſh, therefore no man that will chaſtice his body muſt eate fleſh. Firſt, that that <hi>Daniel</hi> did, is no lawe to vs, becauſe it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vnto vs. Secondly, he did it but for a time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for three weekes: what is this to prooue that it muſt be a continuall lawe for faſting? He did it voluntarily: what warrant can that be to force other men to it? But to come to the very point. I would aſke of our aduerſaries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thinke that <hi>Daniel</hi> commendeth vnto vs his faſt, in that he abſtained from fleſh onely, or that hee abſtained from all dainty fare? If becauſe he abſtained from al dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fare (as ſaint <hi>Hierome</hi> in plaine wordes doth expound it, then it maketh nothing for the forbidding of fleſh onely.<note place="margin"> Iero. in Dan. cap. 1.</note> But that is it that the Papiſts ſo ſtiffely maintaine, and ſo ſuperſtitiouſly hold, that they ſuppoſe themſelues more to breake their faſt, in eating but one bit of fleſh, be it neuer ſo meane, or of little nouriſhing, or neuer ſo little whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate, than if they ſhould eate a ſufficient meale of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and nouriſhing fiſh. Now if one ſhould aſke them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one bit or leſſe of fleſh doeth more pamper our bodie, than a good quanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ie of daintie fiſh, our aduerſaries muſt needes confeſſe, that a ſufficient meale of the one, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth more than the ſmall quantitie of the other. And yet a crumme of fleſh doeth breake their faſt, and a meale
<pb facs="tcp:13152:143"/> of fiſh doth not. So that they make the vnlawfulneſſe to be in the meate it ſelfe: which, howe neere it commeth to the former hereſies, let the world iudge. If they doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the commandement of the church doth make it vnlawfull: I reply, that the church hath not power to take away our chriſtian liberty, neither muſt in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſet downe a conſtant and continuall order, for al times and places. And alſo the reaſon that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth, why the church forbade fleſh, is, for taming of the fleſh, which in this caſe ſet downe is more pampered by the fiſh.<note place="margin"> De operibus bonis in part. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> And therefore the very reſpect that their church had in giuing this commandement, maketh not ſimply gainſt the vſe, but againſt the abuſe of it. So that ſtill the ſtrait forbidding of the vſe of fleſh, with ſuch ſcourings, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and cleanſings of any thing that hath come neare fleſh as they vſe to haue, ſeemeth to come from no other but thoſe ancient heretikes. But they will not be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them: Yet they muſt not take ſcorne to be yoked with the Manichees, whoſe faſtings ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, as like the Popiſh faſting as one egge can be like an other, not in their diet onely, but in their opinion of it alſo. For hee there ſheweth how the Manichees vſing in their faſts, daintie fare, and much ſpice, and coſtly drinkes, woulde yet preferre their faſts before an other that had not touched a peece of reſty bacon with his lippes, whoſe follie hee much inueyeth againſt. And who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,<note place="margin"> De moribus Manichaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum li. 2. c. 13</note> that the faſts of many (euen of them whom they call religious men) amongeſt the Papiſtes are more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing vnto the body, than the beſt feaſt that many a poore man getteth throughout the whole yeare. Yea, one draught of their ſpiced cuppes, is much better than his Chriſtmaſſe dinner? And yet theſe men, whoſe meaneſt meale ſhoulde bee a poore mans feaſt, are ſaide to faſt. And the other, whoſe greateſt fare is with ſcarcitie, doth not faſt. Let our faſt then bee an abſtinence from anie thing that may pamper the fleſh, yet not ſuperſtitious,

For God wee ſee may ſend affliction for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes, and not that wee might ſatiſfie any thing by temporall puniſhment. But maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> replieth againſt this anſwere out of the very wordes. For there it is ſaide,<note place="margin"> 2. Sam. 12.14</note> 
                        <hi>Becauſe thou haſt cauſed the ennemies of the Lorde by this thy deede to blaſpheme, the childe that is borne to thee ſhall ſurely die.</hi> Where he noteth
<pb facs="tcp:13152:145"/> the cauſe ſaieth maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> why <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhould be puniſhed. True, but not thereby to ſatiſfie for that he had done: But that the enemies of God ſeeing the chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that God laieth vpon his children, and how that Gods iudgements begin euen at his owne houſe, and with his owne deare ſeruants,<note place="margin"> 1.

But what is this to purgatorie, for <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne was mortall, and therefore could not be helped by purgatorie, by their own doctrine?<note place="margin"> De purgat. li. 1. cap. 9.</note> for M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, they al agree ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. To what end then doe they bring in <hi>Dauids</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a mortall ſinne, to ſhew howe God will take away veniall ſinnes? or howe doth it folow, <hi>Dauid</hi> was here puniſhed for his ſinne, therefore all men here or elſe where muſt be puniſhed. But to handle this queſtion as briefly as I can, maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, doth handle it doubtfully,<note place="margin"> Iren. lib. 5.</note> and ſo vncertainly, yea, and as <hi>Irene</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſo vnconſequently, and ſo euil agreing with it ſelfe, that he giueth iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect the truth of it. Where the place of purgatorie is they haue not yet agreed,<note place="margin"> Bellar. de purg. li. 2. c. 6 Cap. 6.</note> but are of eight ſundrie minds. And although in the firſt booke of purgatorie maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath alledged ſundrie fathers for proofe of it:<note place="margin"> Cap. 1.</note> yet in the ſecond booke he telleth vs that they are not agreed of it, who ſhall come thether.

But who muſt ſatiſfie for them that are in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie?<note place="margin"> De purg. li. 2. cap. 17.</note> only he that is iuſt. Why then where ſhall they finde prieſts to ſerue the turne. For they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly as bad as who is worſt. And the time will ſcarcely ſerue them to recken vp their owne,<note place="margin"> Li. 2. cap. 10 de purgat.</note> much leſſe ſhall they be able to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for others ſins. Other doubtes alſo there are which M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh of, but cannot certainly reſolue. Is this doctrine to be receiued as catholicke, of ſo manie points whereof euen the greateſt Doctours among them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13152:145"/> do diſagree. No certaine place, no certaine people, no certaine proofe of it. What ſhould we doe with ſuch an vncertaine religion, eſpecially where ſo little good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth towardes vs, and ſo much of our goodes goe from vs? For onely veniall ſinnes they tell vs,<note place="margin"> Veniall ſinnes onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</note> can bee taken away by purgatorie. But for ſuch ſmall faults, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not (as the Papiſts would make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeue) turne vs from God, they can tell vs manie mo eaſie remedies, Holie bread, holy water, giuing a little almes, pardons, Pilgrimages, <hi>Pater noſters,</hi> and <hi>Auies.</hi> And to bee buried in a Monkes Cowle, and bootes, it is a ſoueraigne remedie for ſuch things, or elſe they lie. But one thing I cannot but muſe at, that in this life theſe veniall ſinnes maie ſo eaſilie bee ſatiſfied for, as they all agree: and yet after this life their torments ſhoulde bee ſo grieuous as they report them to bee.

               <head>An abridgement of Vincentius Lirinenſis: with ſome obſeruations vpon the ſaide Author. CHAP. 32.</head>
               <p>NOw in ſteede of a concluſion vnto this treatiſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, I haue thought good to draw into a briefe ſumme that booke of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which is ſo much alleadged againſt vs. Whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſo confidently produce againſt vs in defence of their cauſe, I take his authority to be ſo much the ſtronger againſt them, that euen by the iudgement of their owne witnes (for ſo they recken him) they may bee conuinced of newneſſe and falſhood in their doctrine, and of vntruth in challenging to their errours the name of catholicke faith, and to themſelues of catholicke men or women. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the treatiſe it ſelfe, that we may the better vnderſtand vpon what occaſion he ſo greatly accounteth of the ancient tradition of holy men, for the interpretation of the ſcriptures: firſt wee muſt perſwade our ſelues, that this learned father coulde not bee ignoraunt of that way to finde out the true meaning of the ſcriptures, which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:13152:149"/> fathers a little before his time had ſet downe, namely by conferring one place with another, and by waying the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the place it ſelfe. As <hi>S. Hillary de trin. li. 1. Ambr. in Pſal. 118. Serm. 8. Hierom</hi> vpon <hi>Eſay. 19.1. Baſil in reg. breu. quaeſt. 267. Chryſoſtome</hi> vpon <hi>Gen. hom. 12.</hi> And ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in many places haue plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught. Neither yet muſt we imagine, that <hi>Vincentius</hi> contrary to that which himſelfe teacheth throughout this whole booke, would that this his rule ſhoulde bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the onlie way to finde out the trueth of Gods worde, and that which ſo many before him with ſuch a ful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent haue taught vs ſhoulde bee reiected. Therefore it is cettaine that his meaning is, to ſuch godly waies as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before him haue vſed for trial of the truth, to adde this alſo as a rule that may bee profitable, and doe much good, if it bee vſed wiſely, and truly conſidered of. And the rather did hee teach vs this way, becauſe the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians ſo boldly and confidently preferred their newe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine before the ancient faith, whereof this authour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth fol. <hi>15.</hi> And <hi>Neſtorius</hi> condemned all that were before him as if they knew nothing in compariſon of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as wee maie ſee fol. <hi>54.</hi> For this cauſe <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> teacheth vs in this his booke which hee therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Commonitorium,</hi> an admonition or caueat to auoid the new deuiſes of priuate men, and to holde faſt the ancient faith of the vniuerſal church. And yet although <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lyrinenſis</hi> did then ſee, that that which was then catholicke and auncient it was alſo true, and therefore that then it was a good rule to trie doctrines by: yet the argument of the Church of Rome is too too fooliſh when thus they reaſon. This religion is olde, and hath had approbation of the greateſt number for ſome hundredes of yeares: therefore it is good. For <hi>Vincentius</hi> did looke vnto that faith that was then ancient and catholicke, many hundred yeares before many articles of popiſh religion were hatched. But the papiſtes thinke it enough for them,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13152:149"/> if they can proue their religion to bee nowe olde. Whereas in trueth, and according to <hi>Vincentius</hi> his rule alſo, that which was not then olde, is not now good. That which was not then catholicke, is nowe of all good men to bee reiected. But let vs ſee what <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>After that hee hath declared, how that by opportunity of time and place hee was mooued to write: hee ſheweth that to finde out the falſhoode of hereſies there are two waies. The one by the authoritie of Gods word,<note place="margin"> Gods word ſufficient.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſe rule is perfect, and of it ſelfe ſufficeth for all thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly:</hi> Yet becauſe it is diuerſly expounded (ſuch is the depth thereof) as by example of ſundry hereſies doeth appeare: The ſeconde way to finde out hereſies hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this: By the tradition and rule of the catholicke Church to interpret that which is ſet downe, in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophetes and apoſtles. But ſo as wee take heede, that wee receiue not for Catholicke, euery thing that is holden in the Catholicke Church:<note place="margin"> Catholicke</note> but that onely that is beleeued in all places, and ſo hath vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality, at all times, and ſo hath antiquity, of all or almoſt all the godly and learned, and ſo hath conſent. So that a Catholicke Chriſtian muſt more regarde the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the whole body, than a parte thereof that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>And where the infection is generall, that which hath beene taught of olde, is to bee preferred before the new. But before the auncient errour of two or three, or of one citty or cuntry, a man muſt preferre that which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſally, the vniuerſall Church hath decreede, if anie ſuch bee. If not, then hee muſt conſider of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the ſincereſt fathers, not of a fewe of them, but of all. <hi>What they haue holden, written, taught,</hi>

Iudge nowe, I pray thee, Chriſtian Reader, what Catholike and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent faith it is that the Church of Rome ſo much braggeth of. Compare it with this that <hi>Vincentius</hi> commendeth. If they bee any thing like, I deſire no credite. I will but giue thee a taſte hereof, euen out of one of their chiefe poyntes of their Religion.<note place="margin"> Cap. 2.</note> I haue ſhewed before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by their owne confeſſion, that traditions muſt needes bee admitted, or elſe the Church of Rome muſt needes faile in proofe in many articles of their Religion.

It cannot be that which was <hi>Committed to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> which was <hi>Once deliuered,</hi> as <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſpeaketh often: whoſe growing is without change, whoſe perfection is without addition, ſo that their doctrine of traditions, is a ſtrong argument to proue that their faith is not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, according to <hi>Vincentius</hi> rules. Then alſo we ſee how plainly he defineth, that old hereſies muſt not bee confuted
<pb facs="tcp:13152:154"/> by ſuch arguments, but onely ſuch as are newly ſprung vp. And yet the Papiſts, whoſe religion is almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a ſinke of ſuch old and vnſauourie hereſies, crie ſtill to be tried by their vniuerſalitie, and antiquitie, and the iudgements of men, flat contrarie to <hi>Vincentius</hi> his rules. And this triall he will not haue to be vſed but in great queſtions of fayth, but they make it a proofe for their moſt fooliſh toyes. So that although they readily call him in, becauſe hee nameth Antiquitie, vniuerſalitie and conſent, vnto the which they woulde faine ſeeme to make claime, yet they will (I truſt) from hencefoorth rather ſtoppe his mouth, than ſuffer him to ſpeake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his witneſſe is their ouerthrowe.

Nowe the eſpeciall cauſe that moued me to take vpon mee this enterpriſe (God is my witneſſe) is that dutie that I, and ſuch as I am doe owe to the defence of the trueth by worde, or writing, or any ſuch meanes, whereby wee are bound to occupie vntill our Lord and maſter come, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that he hath committed vnto vs, to his moſt gaine and glorie.

<pb facs="tcp:13152:156"/> they haue a due regarde to place in authoritie ſuch as are worthieſt, and alſo when they heare of their defaultes they ſeeke ſpeedely to reforme the ſame. So that Princes haue high places, with a heauy charge, their honour is great, but greater is their burden, as appeareth by the ſixt Chapter of the booke of Wiſdome. Which Chapter I would wiſh all Princes to be well acquainted withall, that they would make it as it were their looking glaſſe wherein they would vſe to looke daily. For if theſe thinges were well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, (as alas it is too eaſie a thing for the beſt of vs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our duties, and mighty ones, haue not only their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignety, which maketh them many times too proude, but alſo many flatterers to commend in them euen that which is euill) but I ſay if theſe thinges were well remembred, Princes in placing of Magiſtrates either in church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, would not ſo much be abuſed by them, who being corrupted by bribes, or mooued by fauour, or in ſome other worldly conſideration, are content to commend ſuch to be fit to gouerne others, as could neuer yet guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues well.

Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remaineth, that our godly Magiſtrates make profite of theſe good examples, not onely by learning what they may, but in knowing what they muſt doe.

For they knew it to be true, that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaieth, that the happineſſe of kings doeth not conſiſt in their long raigne,<note place="margin"> De ciuit. Dei ib. 5. cap. 24</note>

Vntill ſuch time I ſay, as ſuch as profeſſe the name of chriſtianity within your domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, may in external ſhewe be compelled to come vnto Chriſt, or at the leaſt, not to dare openly to deny him and his trueth, godly Magiſtrates ought ſtill to make their lawes more perfect, that they may haue a remedy for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconuenience.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13152:160"/>
               <p> And theſe lawes ſhould be ſo ſtrong, that they might holde as well the mightieſt as the meaneſt, and not like the ſpiders cobweb, which can take onely the ſmall, or weake flies, but can doe nothing to holde the ſtrong ones. And that is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doeth meane, when hee ſaieth,<note place="margin"> Epiſt. 50.</note> that Lawes ſhoulde bee made with <hi>conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtrength:</hi> For, <hi>if</hi> Poperie and Idolatrie bee euill in one, it is not tollerable in any. And if ſome may without danger of puniſhment breake lawes, or haue exemptions to tranſgreſſe the ſame, it much emboldeneth other to doe the like. And howe in pollicie wiſe men can iudge it to be conuenient I knowe not, but in chriſtianitie I can not ſee howe it may be tollerable, that in a land, where the light of the Goſpell ſhineth, Popery may bee any thing tollerated to any without any puniſhment: For it is as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill as the Idolatrie, which the godly kings of Iudah did ſo bend themſelues to deſtroy, and for the deſtroying wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are commended. As for the exemptions which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Recuſants haue from the penaltie of the lawe, I doubt not, but hoping of doing good, and of winning by faire meanes will be the colour for the ſame. But I doe ſee none more obſtinate, or of whome there is leſſe hope, than ſuch perſons as haue found ſuch fauour. Neyther are theſe diſobedient perſons at any time ſo ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues to dutifull obedience, as when they feare ſome execution of lawes againſt them. Which thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo manifeſt that none can but ſee it, it maketh many to thinke, that ſuch immunities are procured often vpon other conſiderations, than hope of winning them vnto Chriſt. Yea ſome ſue for them ſometimes, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance hope to winne ſomething to themſelues thereby. But of compelling by feare, ſuch to come vnto God, as for loue will not, and of inflicting puniſhment, where meekeneſſe and lenitie preuaile not, I am now to intreate: for this is the ſecond point, wherein Magiſtrates muſt ſerue the Lorde. And although I doe not like of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13152:160"/> or rigor: yet ſo long as wee ſee remiſneſſe to bee hurtfull to the church and common wealth, that which ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth a religious ſeuerity would be vſed: that is, magiſtrates ought to take that way, not that beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their owne humour, but that ſerueth beſt for reducing offendours to the ſeruice of God. If therefore lenitie bee abuſed, and breed licentious libertie, ſo that they who were euill, growe worſe thereby: then lenitie ceaſeth to bee a chriſtian vertue, and is nothing elſe but that fooliſh pittie that marreth the whole citie. In theſe north countries, we haue too good experience heereof. For, meekeneſſe ſome call it, but I take it to bee an exceſſiue want either of care or courage in the Lordes cauſe, hath brought theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to that paſſe, that the ſinnes of the countrey, as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whoredome, thefts, and ſpoiling do abound more than euer they did for many yeeres. As for recuſants, not men onely and women, but euen in ſundry places the children alſo, either may not, or will not come at the church. And that more is, and to be wondered at, there are that dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them that will perfourme that duety. And yet the church of Rome hath not much to brag of this their plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full harueſt, as in many of their bookes they doe: for it is full of filthy weedes. For euen the better ſort of them reſt vpon I knowe not what name of conſcience, without any reaſon of their religion, or ground of their faith. And they being deceiued through their ignorance, doe fall into the pit which falſe teachers, as ignorant almoſt as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, haue made to catch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in. And though amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that do profeſſe religion, there are too many that doe know too little: yet for them to ſeeme to haue a better perſwaſion in religion than the common ſort, who haue ſcarce ſo much knowledge as the common ſort hath to ground their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion vpon, is a great ſkorne. Yea, many there are whoſe conſcience (as it is thought) will ſerue them, ſome to take their neighbours horſe, cow, oxe, or ſheepe by ſtealth, ſome to beare with, and winke at ſuch as doe ſuch things,
<pb facs="tcp:13152:161"/> and yet their conſcience will not ſuffer them to come to the church. Others haue conſcience, that will ſuffer them to liue in continuall whordome, and to lead a moſt filthie life, euen almoſt in the ſight of the ſunne, but to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues dutifull to God and man, it will not ſuffer them. Seeing therfore that as in a ſore, if the ſurgeon forbear to ſearch it to the quicke, it doth but corrupt and putrifie: ſo in this our malady, nothing hath ſo much increaſed the ſame as too much lenity: there is now no other way to mend that is amiſſe, but by ſome due puniſhments to beate downe the pride of the obſtinate, and to reſtraine their inſolencie. I meane not, that life or limme of anie ſhould be touched for religion only (vnleſſe perchaunce the word of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie doe commaund it) for as mildneſſe hath been a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ornament to her maieſties perſon, So I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that it hath beene as a ſtrong pillar to vpholde her eſtate.<note place="margin"> Prou. 20.28.</note> For <hi>mercie and truth preſerue the king, and his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed with mercie:</hi> yet would I haue manie pittied rather than one: That is, that one or ſome few ſhould rather be puniſhed, than whole multitudes by too much gentleneſſe ſhould be imboldened to follow that which is euil. Neither are the puniſhments for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by our law of ſuch qualitie as that there is iuſt cauſe to complaine of the rigour of the ſame: although the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes that they may ſeeme to haue a great number of martyrs and confeſſours, with manie a loude lie, crie out againſt the crueltie that is vſed amongſt vs. Reſtraint of libertie only, would not in the late time of perſecution in Queene Maries daies, haue beene thought crueltie, when moſt ſharpe and vncomfortable impriſonments, and in the ende cruel death, was thought too little for them that could not be charged with any thing, but onely diſſenting in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from the Church of Rome. The paiment of a little money, would then haue beene thought an eaſie redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the libertie of conſcience: and theſe are the moſt grieuous puniſhments, that our lawe in ſuch caſe hath
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13152:161"/> ſet downe. And that theſe chaſticements ſhould nowe with ſome ſeueritie be executed, it is high time: when as ſo many vpon a meere will, or to pleaſe ſome other, will not ſticke to reuolt from that holy profeſſion, which once they followed. Yea, it ſeemeth vnto me a neceſſarie policie, that that penal ſtatute againſt recuſants ſhould more ſeuerely be executed: not onely to haue the greater treaſure in ſtore, for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie defence of the realme: but alſo to withdrawe from hollow hearted ſubiects, that wherewith they do either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurablie inrich and furniſh themſelues againſt that euil day which ſo long they haue looked for, or in the mean time relieue bad perſons to be trumpets of rebellion. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thoſe lying ſpirits blow it abroad, that catholiks (for ſo they falſely tearme them) are in moſt cruell maner perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in England for religion: yet it is moſt certaine, that there are an infinite number of knowne and ſtubborne recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants among vs, that feele no ſmart at all. Which thing alſo I would wiſh that by ſome meanes they might bee made publikely to confeſſe, therby to confute and confound the ſhameleſſe ſlaunders of their lying maſters. And ſuch as are impriſoned can not iuſtly complaine of want of anie thing neceſſarie, vnleſſe it be libertie. They are not forced to lie vpon the ground, or to ſit vneaſilie in the ſtockes, They are not loaden with boltes and fetters, or anie other way cruelly handled, as many good men were in the dayes of our late perſecution. No, no, we willingly leaue thoſe cruel torments to the bloudie papiſts, to that purple Harlot that ſitteth at Rome: who is euen drunken with the blood of the ſaints, and hath a delight to torment and make hauocke of the people of God.<note place="margin"> Lib. 2.</note> To ſuch as <hi>Dinothus</hi> in his ſtorie of the warres of Fraunce ſpeaketh of: For hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that when the papiſts, that ſauage generation, had woonne <hi>Auraſia,</hi> they ſpared no ſexe, no age, no eſtate, no not ſucking babes: they deuiſed new &amp; thoſe cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (for to kil only cannot ſuffice that catholike humor.)

They are too many, and vpon euery ſmall occaſion of hope of their bloudie day, verie bolde (whereby we may conſider what ſubiects they are.) They are dangerous ſnakes to carrie in our boſome. If inquirie ſhould be made how many haue beene preſented, that were neuer called before authoritie, and howe many called, that haue beene ſent home againe, as free as before they came to the magiſtrate, and yet as bad alſo as euer they were, I ſuppoſe they will be found manie.

So that they are almoſt in no place, more free to doe, or ſay what they will, than in their priſons, whereby they corrupt many. This fault I truſt, is not generall, but in ſome places it is ſo.

And although that accurſed company will (no doubt) deny the Scriptures, and count them but as fabulous, yet Gods actes and deedes therein contained, as alſo the ſtorie of all times doeth ſufficiently teſtifie vnto the worlde, that God is wiſe, mightie, good, and iuſt. The very heathen men therefore, founde him out by his workes, and could not but confeſſe that there muſt be a God: although not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to knowe him by his worde, they became vaine in their imaginations, and conceites of this God: But that there is a God, they did all ſee it.

God forbid that in any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian common wealth there ſhoulde bee any founde ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and witleſſe, as once to thinke ſo irreligiouſly. But to ſpeake it, and that not in ſecret, but in the hearing of others, or to defend it as an opinion that they would haue to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, is ſo deteſtable a ſinne before God, as if it bee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red will be the vtter ruine of this land. Take away the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured perſuaſion of God, out of the heartes of the people, and how ſhal obedience be perfourmed to Magiſtrates, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to parents, ſeruice to maiſters, or duty to all ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours for the Lordes ſake? Let their prophane opinion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and neither ſhal the godly haue any incouragement to ſerue in feare, neither the wicked any bridle to reſtraine them from euil. Theſe corruptions therefore of a common
<pb facs="tcp:13152:165"/> wealth, theſe enemies to al honeſt and Chriſtian life, ought not to bee ſuffered to liue amongſt men, much leſſe to enioy any eſtimation or credit by chriſtian Magiſtrats. Neither can this perſuaſion once enter into the hearte of any, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be ſuch, as becauſe they woulde liue diſſolutelie in all luſt and pleaſure, as the prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin"> Amos. 6.3.

Or els ſuch as being drunken in their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and aduanced perchaunce far aboue their worth, doe thinke as did the wicked men of whom <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin"> Mal. 2.17.</note> that if there were a God of iuſtice, it coulde not bee ſo well with them, and ſo in their exceſſe of pride they deny God &amp; ſay who is Lord? And although I truſt that none amongſt vs, are com to the depth of that impiety: yet becauſe it is too true, that many will haue ſuch prophane talke, and delight too much therin, &amp; that ſome of them ſuch as ſeeme not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in their own eies: if ſharpe puniſhments be not inflicted, for ſuch irreligious and wicked ſpeeches, themſelues will more &amp; more be hardened in their euil, and others more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to like of their vngodlines. Therfore theſe biles &amp; ſores of a common wealth, are of all chriſtians to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as vnworthy to liue among Gods people, &amp; of al godly magiſtrats, ſuch are to be reſtrained, not by lawes only, but by the ſharpeſt puniſhments. And if magiſtrates would not doe their duty therin (which God forbid) yet let al true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians take heede they touch no ſuch pitch,<note place="margin"> Eccle. 13.1. 1. Cor. 15.33. Iud. 52.</note> leaſt they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with it, nor giue eare to ſuch talke, leaſt it corrupt their good manners. Yea let them put away ſuch ſpottes from their feaſtes, for the company is the worſe that they are in, what account ſo euer they make of themſelues. Withal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence therefore, inquiry would be made for detecting, and ſtrait order taken for the puniſhing of ſuch: For as al ſinnes procure Gods wrath, eſpecially if they be borne withal, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13152:165"/> God in his wrath ſendeth his plagues: ſo eſpecially ſuch great blaſphemies as this, as hath with it a manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and his worde, bringeth for the moſt parte a generall deſtruction.<note place="margin"> Prou. 8.15.</note> If Princes therefore bee Gods lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantes, and ſupply his roome, as indeede they doe, if by him they beare rule as <hi>Salomon</hi> affirmeth, it is their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to watch all opportunities, to reforme if it maie be, or elſe to roote out their maiſters enemies, and to imploy their whole power in defence of his glorie, who ſetteth them in honour, eſtabliſheth their authority, ſubdueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them their ſubiectes, giueth peace in their lande, when neede is if it ſeeme good to him, vanquiſheth their enemies, to bee ſhorte, without whom they haue no power. Let it neuer bee ſaide, that in a lande wherein the goſpell is ſo conſtantly and zealouſly profeſſed, and by ſo many godlie lawes eſtabliſhed, it ſhall bee lawfull for ſome ſeduced, but very ſelfe-willed folkes, ſuch as recuſantes are for the moſt parte, to reiect it without all feare of puniſhment, or for a prophane crew, ſuch are theſe Atheiſtes, to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God without controlement. If wee loue the truth, let vs with courage ſet our ſelues againſt the enemies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If wee feare God truely, let vs alſo feare to bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their ſinnes that will not acknowledge him. But priuate perſons that allowe, or doe not reprooue, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that doe not refourme ſuch ſinnes, are partakers thereof. Rowze vp your ſelues therefore (O Chriſtian magiſtrats) be zealous in his cauſe, that is ſo louing to you. Be faithful vnto him, that neuer deceiued any that truſted in him. Beate downe ſinne, maintaine the trueth, cheriſh the godlie, againſt all popiſh heretickes, againſt all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Atheiſtes, that ſuch as doe euill may feare, and know that <hi>Magiſtrats beare not the ſword for naught.</hi>
                  <note place="margin"> Rom. 13.4.</note> Thinke it to be the beſt pollicie to ſerue the Lord ſincerely: For ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (but his leſſon is not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny politickes well learned) <hi>Keepe therefore</hi> (ſaith he) and do them, <hi>for that is your wiſedome:</hi> And that it is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be colde or careleſſe in Gods cauſe,<note place="margin"> Deut. 4.6.</note> for it procureth
